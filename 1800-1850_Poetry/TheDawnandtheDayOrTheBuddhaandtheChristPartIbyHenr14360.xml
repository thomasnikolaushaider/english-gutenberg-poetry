    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">When Humboldt first ascended the Andes and saw the trees , shrubs and flora he had long before studied on the Alps , he had only to look at his barometer , or at the sea of mountains and hills below , the rocks and soil around , and the sun above , to understand this seeming marvel of creation ; while those who knew less of the laws of order and universal harmony might be lost in conjectures about pollen floating in the upper air , or seeds carried by birds across seas , forgetting that preservation is perpetual creation , and that it takes no more power to clothe a mountain just risen from the sea in appropriate verdure than to renew the beauty and the bloom of spring .</p>
    <p n="2">Max Mueller , who looks through antiquity with the same clear vision with which Humboldt examined the physical world , when he found the most ancient Hindoos bowing in worship before Dyaus Pitar , the exact equivalent of the Zeus Pater of the Greeks and the Jupiter of the Romans , and of “ Our Father who art in the heavens ” in our own divinely taught prayer , instead of indulging in wild speculations about the chance belief of some ancient chief or patriarch , transmitted across continents and seas and even across the great gulf that has always divided the Aryan from the Semitic civilization and preserved through ages of darkness and unbelief , saw in it the common yearning of the human soul to find rest on a loving Father 's almighty arm ; yet when our oriental missionaries and scholars found such fundamental truths of their own religion as the common brotherhood of man , and that love is the vital force of all religion , which consists not in blood-oblations or in forms and creeds , but in shunning evil and doing good , and that we must overcome evil by good and hatred by love , and that there is a spiritual world and life after death embodied in the teachings of Buddha — instead of finding in this great fact new proof of the common Father 's love for all His children , they immediately began to indulge in conjectures as to how these truths might have been derived from the early Christians who visited the East , while those who were disposed to reject the claims of Christianity have exhausted research and conjecture to find something looking as if Christianity itself might have been derived from the Buddhist missionaries to Palestine and Egypt , both overlooking the remarkable fact that it is only in fundamental truths that the two religions agree , while in the dogmas , legends , creeds and speculations which form the wall of separation between them they are as wide asunder as the poles .</p>
    <p n="3">How comes it on the one theory that the Nestorians , whose peculiar creed had already separated them from the balance of the Christian church , taught their Buddhist disciples no part of that creed to which they have adhered with such tenacity through the ages ? And on the other theory , how comes it , if the Divine Master was , as some modern writers claim , an Essene , that is , a Buddhist monk , that there is not in all his teachings a trace of the speculations and legends which had already buried the fundamental truths of Buddhism almost out of sight ?</p>
    <p n="4">How sad to hear a distinguished Christian scholar like Sir Monier Williams cautioning his readers against giving a Christian meaning to the Christian expressions he constantly met with in Buddhism , and yet informing them that a learned and distinguished Japanese gentleman told him it was a source of great delight to him to find so many of his most cherished religious beliefs in the New Testament ; and to see an earnest Christian missionary like good Father Huc , when in the busy city of Lha-ssa , on the approach of evening , at the sound of a bell the whole population sunk on their knees in a concert of prayer , only finding in it an attempt of Satan to counterfeit Christian worship ; and on the other hand to see ancient and modern learning ransacked to prove that the brightest and clearest light that ever burst upon a sinful and benighted world was but the reflected rays of another faith .</p>
    <p n="5">And yet this same Sir Monier Williams says : “ We shall not be far wrong in attempting an outline of the Buddha 's life if we begin by assuming that intense individuality , fervid earnestness and severe simplicity , combined with singular beauty of countenance , calm dignity of bearing , and almost superhuman persuasiveness of speech , were conspicuous in the great teacher . ” To believe that such a character was the product of a false religion , or that he was given over to believe a lie , savors too much of that worst agnosticism which would in effect deny the universality of God 's love and would limit His care to some favored locality or age or race .</p>
    <p n="6">How much more in harmony with the broad philosophy of such men as Humboldt and Mueller , and with the character of a loving Father , to believe that at all times and in all countries He has been watching over all His children and giving them all the light they were capable of receiving .</p>
    <p n="7">This narrow view is especially out of place in treating of Buddhism and Christianity , as Buddha himself predicted that his Dharma would last but five hundred years , when he would be succeeded by Matreya , that is , Love incarnate , on which account the whole Buddhist world was on tiptoe of expectation at the time of the coming of our Lord , so that the wise men of the East were not only following their guiding-star but the prediction of their own great prophet in seeking Bethlehem .</p>
    <p n="8">Had the Christian missionaries to the East left behind them their creeds , which have only served to divide Christians into hostile sects and sometimes into hostile camps , and which so far as I can see , after years of patient study , have no necessary connection with the simple , living truths taught by our Saviour , and had taken only their New Testaments and their earnest desire to do good , the history of missions would have been widely different .</p>
    <p n="9">How of the earth earthy seemed the walls that divided the delegates to the world 's great Congress of Religions , recently held in Chicago , and how altogether divine</p>
    <p n="10">The love which like an endless golden chain Joined all in one .</p>
    <p n="11">Whatever others may think , it is my firm belief that Buddhism and Christianity , which we cannot doubt have influenced for good such vast masses the human family , both descended from heaven clothed in robes of celestial purity which have become sadly stained by their contact with the selfishness of a sinful world , except for which belief the following pages would never have been written , which are now sent forth in the hope that they may do something to enable Buddhists and Christians to see eye to eye and something to promote peace and good-will among men .</p>
    <p n="12">While following my own conceptions and even fancies in many things , I believe the leading characters and incidents to be historical , and I have given nothing as the teaching of the great master which was not to my mind clearly authenticated .</p>
    <p n="13">To those who have read so much about agnostic Buddhism , and about Nirvana meaning annihilation , it may seem bold in me to present Buddha as an undoubting believer in the fundamental truths of all religion , and as not only a believer in a spiritual world but an actual visitor to its sad and blissful scenes ; but the only agnosticism I have been able to trace to Buddha was a want of faith in the many ways invented through the ages to escape the consequences of sin and to avoid the necessity of personal purification , and the only annihilation he taught and yearned for was the annihilation of self in the highest Christian sense , and escape from that body of death from which the Apostle Paul so earnestly sought deliverance .</p>
    <p n="14">Doubtless agnosticism and almost every form of belief and unbelief subsequently sprang up among the intensely acute and speculative peoples of the East known under the general name of Buddhists , as they did among the less acute and speculative peoples of the West known as Christians ; but the one is no more primitive Buddhism than the other is primitive Christianity .</p>
    <p n="15">While there are innumerable poetic legends — of which Spence Hardy 's “ Manual of Buddhism ” is a great storehouse , and many of which are given by Arnold in his beautiful poem — strewn thick along the track of Buddhist literature , constantly tempting one to leave the straight path of the development of a great religion , I have carefully avoided what did not commend itself to my mind as either historical or spiritual truth .</p>
    <p n="16">It was my original design to follow the wonderful career of Buddha until his long life closed with visions of the golden city much as described in Revelation , and then to follow that most wonderful career of Buddhist missions , not only through India and Ceylon , but to Palestine , Greece and Egypt , and over the table-lands of Asia and through the Chinese Empire to Japan , and thence by the black stream to Mexico and Central America , and then to follow the wise men of the East until the Light of the world dawned on them on the plains of Bethlehem — a task but half accomplished , which I shall yet complete if life and strength are spared .</p>
    <p n="17">A valued literary friend suggests that the social life described in the following pages is too much like ours , but why should their daily life and social customs be greatly different from ours ? The Aryan migrations to India and to Europe were in large masses , of course taking their social customs , or as the Romans would say , their household gods , with them .</p>
    <p n="18">What wonder , then , that the home as Tacitus describes it in the “ Wilds of Germany ” was substantially what Mueller finds from the very structure of the Sanscrit and European languages it must have been in Bactria , the common cradle of the Aryan race . There can scarcely be a doubt that twenty-five hundred years ago the daily life and social customs in the north of India , which had been under undisputed Aryan control long enough for the Sanscrit language to spring up , come to perfection and finally become obsolete , were more like ours than like those of modern India after the , many — and especially the Mohammedan — conquests and after centuries of oppression and alien rule .</p>
    <p n="19">If a thousand English-speaking Aryans should now be placed on some distant island , how much would their social customs and even amusements differ from ours in a hundred years ? Only so far as changed climate and surrounding 's compelled .</p>
    <p n="20">I give as an introduction an outline of the golden , silver , brazen and iron ages , as described by the ancient poets and believed in by all antiquity , as it was in the very depths of the darkness of the iron age that our great light appeared in Northern India . The very denseness of the darkness of the age in which he came makes the clearness of the light more wonderful , and accounts for the joy with which it was received and the rapidity with which it spread .</p>
    <p n="21">Not to enter into the niceties of chronological questions , the mission of Buddha may be roughly said to have commenced about five hundred years before the commencement of our era , and with incessant labors and long and repeated journeys to have lasted forty-five years , when at about the age of eighty he died , or , as the Buddhists more truthfully and more beautifully say , entered Nirvana .</p>

    <docImprint>Since this work was in the hands of the printer I have read the recent work of Bishop Copelston , of Columbo , Ceylon , and it was a source of no small gratification to find him in all material points agreeing with the result of my somewhat extensive investigations as given within , for in Ceylon , if anywhere , we would expect accuracy . Here the great Buddhist development first comes in contact with authentic history during the third century B. C . in the reign of the great Asoka , the discovery of whose rock inscriptions shed such a flood of light on primitive Buddhism , while it still retained enough of its primitive power , as we learn from those inscriptions themselves , to turn that monarch from a course of cruel tyranny , and , as we learn from the history of Ceylon , to induce his son and daughter to abandon royalty and become the first missionaries to that beautiful island .

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="23">The golden age — when men were brothers all , The golden rule their law and God their king ; When no fierce beasts did through the forests roam , Nor poisonous reptiles crawl upon the ground ; When trees bore only wholesome , luscious fruits , And thornless roses breathed their sweet perfumes ; When sickness , sin and sorrow were unknown , And tears but spoke of joy too deep for words ; When painless death but led to higher life , A life that knows no end , in that bright world Whence angels on the ladder Jacob saw , Descending , talk with man as friend to friend — That age of purity and peace had passed , But left a living memory behind , Cherished and handed down from sire to son Through all the scattered peoples of the earth , A living prophecy of what this world , This sad and sinful world , might yet become .</p>
    <p n="24">The silver age — an age of faith , not sight — Came next , when reason ruled instead of love ; When men as through a glass but darkly saw What to their fathers clearly stood revealed In God 's own light of love-illumined truth , Of which the sun that rising paints the east , And whose last rays with glory gild the west , Is but an outbirth . Then were temples reared , And priests ‘ mid clouds of incense sang His praise Who out of densest darkness called the light , And from His own unbounded fullness made The heavens and earth and all that in them is . Then landmarks were first set , lest men contend For God 's free gifts , that all in peace had shared . Then laws were made to govern those whose sires Were laws unto themselves . Then sickness came , And grief and pain attended men from birth to death . But still a silver light lined every cloud , And hope was given to cheer and comfort men .</p>
    <p n="25">The brazen age , brilliant but cold , succeeds . This was an age of knowledge , art and war , When the knights-errant of the ancient world , Adventures seeking , roamed with brazen swords Which by a wondrous art — then known , now lost — Were hard as flint , and edged to cut a hair Or cleave in twain a warrior armor-clad And armed with shields adorned by Vulcan 's art , Wonder of coming times and theme for bards .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Then science searched through nature 's heights and depths . Heaven 's canopy thick set with stars was mapped , The constellations named , and all the laws searched out That guide their motions , rolling sphere on sphere .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Then men by reasonings piled up mountain high Thought to scale heaven , and to dethrone heaven 's king , Whose imitators weak , with quips and quirks And ridicule would now destroy all sacred things . This age great Homer and old Hesiod sang , And gods they made of hero , artist , bard .</p>
    <p n="26">At length this twilight of the ages fades , And starless night now sinks upon the world — An age of iron , cruel , dark and cold . On Asia first this outer darkness fell , Once seat of paradise , primordial peace , Perennial harmony and perfect love . A despot 's will was then a nation 's law ; An idol 's car crushed out poor human lives , And human blood polluted many shrines . Then human speculation made of God A shoreless ocean , distant , waveless , vast , Of truth that sees not and unfeeling love , Whence souls as drops were taken back to fall , Absorbed and lost , when , countless ages passed , They should complete their round as souls of men , Of beasts , of birds and of all creeping things . And , even worse , the cruel iron castes , One caste too holy for another 's touch , Had every human aspiration crushed , The common brotherhood of man destroyed , And made all men but Pharisees or slaves . And worst of all — and what could e'en be worse ?— Woman , bone of man 's bone , flesh of his flesh , The equal partner of a double life , Who in the world 's best days stood by his side To lighten every care , and heighten every joy , And in the world 's decline still clung to him , She only true when all beside were false , When all were cruel she alone still kind , Light of his hearth and mistress of his home , Sole spot where peace and joy could still be found — Woman herself cast down , despised was made Slave to man 's luxury and brutal lust . Then war was rapine , havoc , needless blood , Infants impaled before their mothers ’ eyes , Women dishonored , mutilated , slain , Parents but spared to see their children die . Then peace was but a faithless , hollow truce , With plots and counter-plots ; the dagger 's point And poisoned cup instead of open war ; And life a savage , grim conspiracy Of mutual murder , treachery and greed . O dark and cruel age ! O cruel creeds ! O cruel men ! O crushed and bleeding hearts , That from the very ground in anguish cry : “ Is there no light — no hope — no help — no God ? ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Northward from Ganges ’ stream and India 's plains</l>
     <l n="2">An ancient city crowned a lofty hill ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose high embattled walls had often rolled</l>
     <l n="4">The surging , angry tide of battle back .</l>
     <l n="5">Walled on three sides , but on the north a cliff ,</l>
     <l n="6">At once the city 's quarry and its guard ,</l>
     <l n="7">Cut out in galleries , with vaulted roofs<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="8">Upborne upon cyclopean columns vast ,</l>
     <l n="9">Chiseled with art , their capitals adorned</l>
     <l n="10">With lions , elephants , and bulls , life size ,</l>
     <l n="11">Once dedicate to many monstrous gods</l>
     <l n="12">Before the Aryan race as victors came ,</l>
     <l n="13">Then prisons , granaries and magazines ,</l>
     <l n="14">Now only known to bandits and wild beasts .</l>
     <l n="15">This cliff , extending at each end , bends north ,</l>
     <l n="16">And rises in two mountain-chains that end</l>
     <l n="17">In two vast snow-capped Himalayan peaks ,</l>
     <l n="18">Between which runs a glittering glacial stream ,</l>
     <l n="19">A mighty moving mass of crystal ice ,</l>
     <l n="20">Crushing the rocks in its resistless course ;</l>
     <l n="21">From which bursts forth a river that had made</l>
     <l n="22">Of all this valley one great highland lake ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which on one side had burst its bounds and cut</l>
     <l n="24">In myriad years a channel through the rock ,</l>
     <l n="25">So narrow that a goat might almost leap</l>
     <l n="26">From cliff to cliff — these cliffs so smooth and steep</l>
     <l n="27">The eagles scarce could build upon their sides ;</l>
     <l n="28">This yawning chasm so deep one scarce could hear</l>
     <l n="29">The angry waters roaring far below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="30">This stream , guided by art , now fed a lake</l>
     <l n="31">Above the city and behind this cliff ,</l>
     <l n="32">Which , guided thence in channels through the rock ,</l>
     <l n="33">Fed many fountains , sending crystal streams</l>
     <l n="34">Through every street and down the terraced hill ,</l>
     <l n="35">And through the plain in little silver streams ,</l>
     <l n="36">Spreading the richest verdure far and wide .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="37">Here was the seat of King Suddhodana ,</l>
     <l n="38">His royal park , walled by eternal hills ,</l>
     <l n="39">Where trees and shrubs and flowers all native grew ;</l>
     <l n="40">For in its bounds all the four seasons met ,</l>
     <l n="41">From ever-laughing , ever-blooming spring</l>
     <l n="42">To savage winter with eternal snows .</l>
     <l n="43">Here stately palms , the banyan 's many trunks ,</l>
     <l n="44">Darkening whole acres with its grateful shade ,</l>
     <l n="45">And bamboo groves , with graceful waving plumes ,</l>
     <l n="46">The champak , with its fragrant golden flowers ,</l>
     <l n="47">Asokas , one bright blaze of brilliant bloom ,</l>
     <l n="48">The mohra , yielding food and oil and wine ,</l>
     <l n="49">The sacred sandal and the spreading oak ,</l>
     <l n="50">The mountain-loving fir and spruce and pine ,</l>
     <l n="51">And giant cedars , grandest of them all ,</l>
     <l n="52">Planted in ages past , and thinned and pruned</l>
     <l n="53">With that high art that hides all trace of art ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="54">Were placed to please the eye and show their form</l>
     <l n="55">In groves , in clumps , in jungles and alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="56">Here all a forest seemed ; there open groves ,</l>
     <l n="57">With vine-clad trees , vines hanging from each limb ,</l>
     <l n="58">A pendant chain of bloom , with shaded drives</l>
     <l n="59">And walks , with rustic seats , cool grots and dells ,</l>
     <l n="60">With fountains playing and with babbling brooks ,</l>
     <l n="61">And stately swans sailing on little lakes ,</l>
     <l n="62">While peacocks , rainbow-tinted shrikes , pheasants ,</l>
     <l n="63">Glittering like precious stones , parrots , and birds</l>
     <l n="64">Of all rich plumage , fly from tree to tree ,</l>
     <l n="65">The whole scene vocal with sweet varied song ;</l>
     <l n="66">And here a widespread lawn bedecked with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="67">With clumps of brilliant roses grown to trees ,</l>
     <l n="68">And fields with dahlias spread ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>not stiff and prim</l>
     <l n="69">Like the starched ruffle of an ancient dame ,</l>
     <l n="70">But growing in luxuriance rich and wild ,</l>
     <l n="71">The colors of the evening and the rainbow joined ,</l>
     <l n="72">White , scarlet , yellow , crimson , deep maroon ,</l>
     <l n="73">Blending all colors in one dazzling blaze ;</l>
     <l n="74">There orchards bend beneath their luscious loads ;</l>
     <l n="75">Here vineyards climb the hills thick set with grapes ;</l>
     <l n="76">There rolling pastures spread , where royal mares ,</l>
     <l n="77">High bred , and colts too young for bit or spur ,</l>
     <l n="78">Now quiet feed , then , as at trumpet 's call ,</l>
     <l n="79">With lion bounds , tails floating , neck outstretched ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
     <l n="80">Nostrils distended , fleet as the flying wind</l>
     <l n="81">They skim the plain , and sweep in circles wide —</l>
     <l n="82">Nature 's Olympic , copied , ne'er excelled .</l>
     <l n="83">Here , deer with dappled fawn bound o'er the grass ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
     <l n="84">And sacred herds , and sheep with skipping lambs ;</l>
     <l n="85">There , great white elephants in quiet nooks ;</l>
     <l n="86">While high on cliffs framed in with living green</l>
     <l n="87">Goats climb and seem to hang and feed in air —</l>
     <l n="88">Sweet spot , with all to please and nothing to offend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="89">Here on a hill the royal palace stood ,</l>
     <l n="90">A gem of art ; and near , another hill ,</l>
     <l n="91">Its top crowned by an aged banyan tree ,</l>
     <l n="92">Its sides clad in strange jyotismati grass ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>
     <l n="93">By day a sober brown , but in the night</l>
     <l n="94">Glowing as if the hill were all aflame —</l>
     <l n="95">Twin wonders to the dwellers in the plain ,</l>
     <l n="96">Their guides and landmarks day and night ,</l>
     <l n="97">This glittering palace and this glowing hill .</l>
     <l n="98">Within , above the palace rose a tower ,</l>
     <l n="99">Which memory knew but as the ancient tower ,</l>
     <l n="100">Foursquare and high , an altar and a shrine</l>
     <l n="101">On its broad top , where burned perpetual fire ,</l>
     <l n="102">Emblem of boundless and eternal love</l>
     <l n="103">And truth that knows no night , no cloud , no change ,</l>
     <l n="104">Long since gone out , with that most ancient faith</l>
     <l n="105">In one great Father , source of life and light .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
     <l n="106">Still round this ancient tower , strange hopes and fears ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>The Brahmans claim that Buddha 's great doctrine of universal brotherhood was taken from their sacred books and was not an originality of Buddha , as his followers claim .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>At the time of Buddha 's birth there seemed to be no mean between the Chakravartin or absolute monarch and the recluse who had renounced all ordinary duties and enjoyments , and was subjecting himself to all deprivations and sufferings .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>I am aware that some Buddhist authors whom Arnold has followed in his “ Light of Asia ” make Buddha but little better than a stale prisoner , and would have us believe that the glimpses he got of the ills that flesh is heir to were gained in spite of all precautions , as he was occasionally taken out of his rose embowered , damsel filled prison-house , and not as any prince of high intelligence and tender sensibilities who loved his people and mingled freely with them would gain a knowledge of suffering and sorrow ; but we are justified in passing all such fancies , not only on account of their intrinsic improbability , but because the great Asvaghosha , who wrote about the beginning of our era , knew nothing of them .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>To suppose that the Aryan races when they emigrated to India or Europe left behind them their most valuable possession , the Nisaean horse , is to suppose them lacking in the qualities of thrift and shrewdness which have distinguished their descendants . That the Nisaean horse of the table-lands of Asia was the horse of the armored knights of the middle ages and substantially the Percheron horse of France , I had a curious proof : In Layard 's Nineveh is a picture of a Nisaean horse found among the ruins , which would have been taken as a good picture Of a Percheron stallion I once owned , who stood for the picture here drawn of what I regard as his undoubted ancestor .</p>

     <l n="127">No longer pressed so far beyond their power ,</l>
     <l n="128">With long and even strides sweep smoothly on ,</l>
     <l n="129">Striking the earth as with a single blow ,</l>
     <l n="130">Their hot breath rising in a single cloud .</l>
     <l n="131">Arab and Tartar with a longer stride</l>

     <l n="140">These ringing trumpet-calls that brought defeat</l>
     <l n="141">Or victory so near , startle and rouse .</l>
     <l n="142">The charioteers more ardent urge their steeds ;</l>
     <l n="143">The steeds are with hot emulation fired ;</l>
     <l n="144">The social multitude now cease to talk —</l>
     <l n="145">Even age stops short in stories often told ;</l>
     <l n="146">Boys , downy-chinned , in rough-and-tumble sports</l>
     <l n="147">Like half-grown bears engaged , turn quick and look ;</l>

     <l n="150">With sly and sidelong look the rougher sports ,</l>
     <l n="151">Turn eagerly to see the scene below ;</l>
     <l n="152">While mothers for the time forget their babes ,</l>

     <l n="154">To tell the tale that all the past has told</l>
     <l n="155">And coming times will tell , stand mute and gaze .</l>
     <l n="156">The home-stretch soon is reached , and Channa 's three</l>

     <l n="162">Chides his fleet pets , with lash swung high in air</l>
     <l n="163">Wounds their proud spirits , not their tender flesh .</l>
     <l n="164">With lion-bounds they pass the Tartar steeds ,</l>
     <l n="165">That with hot rival rage and open mouths ,</l>
     <l n="166">And flaming eyes , and fierce and angry cries ,</l>
     <l n="167">Dash full at Regil 's side , but dash in vain .</l>
     <l n="168">Fear adding speed , the Arabs sweep ahead .</l>
     <l n="169">Meanwhile the prince springs forward from his seat ,</l>
     <l n="170">And all on tiptoe still and eager stand ,</l>

     <l n="173">Alone the universal stillness break —</l>
     <l n="174">As when before the bursting of some fearful storm ,</l>
     <l n="175">Birds , beasts and men stand mute with trembling awe ,</l>
     <l n="176">While heaven 's artillery and roaring winds</l>

     <l n="178">But when the double victory is gained ,</l>
     <l n="179">Drums , shells and trumpets mingle with the shouts</l>
     <l n="180">From hill to hill re-echoed and renewed —</l>
     <l n="181">As when , after the morning 's threatening bow ,</l>
     <l n="182">Dark , lurid , whirling clouds obscure the day ,</l>
     <l n="183">And forked lightnings dart athwart the sky ,</l>
     <l n="184">And angry winds roll up the boiling sea ,</l>
     <l n="185">And thunder , raging winds and warring waves</l>

     <l n="191">Some choice memorial of the happy day —</l>
     <l n="192">Cinctures to all athletes to gird the loins</l>
     <l n="193">And falling just below the knee , the belt</l>
     <l n="194">Of stoutest leather , joined with silver clasps ,</l>
     <l n="195">The skirt of softest wool or finest silk ,</l>
     <l n="196">Adorned with needlework and decked with gems ,</l>
     <l n="197">Such as the modest Aryans always wore</l>
     <l n="198">In games intended for the public view ,</l>
     <l n="199">Before the Greeks became degenerate ,</l>
     <l n="200">And savage Rome compelled those noble men</l>
     <l n="201">Whose only crime was love of liberty ,</l>
     <l n="202">By discipline and numbers overwhelmed ,</l>
     <l n="203">Bravely defending children , wife and home ,</l>
     <l n="204">Naked to fight each other or wild beasts ,</l>
     <l n="205">And called this brutal savagery high sport</l>
     <l n="206">For them and for their proud degenerate dames ,</l>
     <l n="207">Of whom few were what Caesar 's wife should be .</l>
     <l n="208">The athletes ’ prizes all were rich and rare ,</l>
     <l n="209">Some costly emblem of their several arts .</l>
     <l n="210">The archers ’ prizes all were bows ; the first</l>
     <l n="211">Made from the horns of a great mountain-goat</l>
     <l n="212">That long had ranged the Himalayan heights ,</l>
     <l n="213">Till some bold hunter climbed his giddy cliffs</l>
     <l n="214">And brought his unsuspecting victim down .</l>
     <l n="215">His lofty horns the bowsmith root to root</l>
     <l n="216">Had firmly joined , and polished , bright ,</l>
     <l n="217">And tipped with finest gold , and made a bow</l>
     <l n="218">Worthy of Sinhahamu 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>mighty arm .</l>
     <l n="219">The other prizes , bows of lesser strength</l>
     <l n="220">But better suited to their weaker arms .</l>
     <l n="221">A chariot , the charioteers ’ first prize ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="222">Its slender hubs made strong with brazen bands ,</l>
     <l n="223">The spokes of whitest ivory polished bright ,</l>
     <l n="224">The fellies ebony , with tires of bronze ,</l>
     <l n="225">Each axle 's end a brazen tiger 's head ,</l>
     <l n="226">The body woven of slender bamboo shoots</l>
     <l n="227">Intwined with silver wire and decked with gold .</l>
     <l n="228">A mare and colt of the victorious breed</l>
     <l n="229">The second prize , more worth in Timour 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="230">Than forty chariots , though each were made</l>
     <l n="231">Of ebony or ivory or gold ,</l>
     <l n="232">And all the laurel India ever grew .</l>
     <l n="233">The third , a tunic of soft Cashmere wool ,</l>
     <l n="234">On which , by skillful needles deftly wrought ,</l>
     <l n="235">The race itself as if in life stood forth .</l>
     <l n="236">The fourth , a belt to gird the laggard 's loins</l>

     <l n="244">This day his mission ceased to press the prince ,</l>
     <l n="245">And he forgot the sorrows of the world ,</l>
     <l n="246">So deep and earnest seemed the general joy .</l>
     <l n="247">Even those with grinning skeletons at home</l>
     <l n="248">In secret closets locked from public view ,</l>

     <l n="263">And when her eyes met his her rosy blush</l>
     <l n="264">Told what her maiden modesty would hide .</l>
     <l n="265">And at the dance , when her soft hands touched his</l>

     <l n="267">But when she bowed and passed to other hands ,</l>
     <l n="268">Winding the mystic measure of the dance ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="269">The music seemed to slacken , time to halt ,</l>
     <l n="270">Or drag his limping moments lingering on .</l>
     <l n="271">At length , after the dance , the beauties passed</l>

     <l n="277">The prizes all were gone ; but from his neck</l>
     <l n="278">He took a golden chain thick set with gems ,</l>
     <l n="279">And clasped it round her slender waist , and said :</l>

     <l n="287">Asita , oldest of his counselors ,</l>
     <l n="288">Sprang to his side and asked : “ What ails the king ? ”</l>

     <l n="298">Often in stillest night 's most silent hour ,</l>
     <l n="299">When the sly nibbling of a timid mouse</l>

     <l n="74">Speak freely — what I can , I freely give . ”</l>
     <l n="75">“ Most noble prince , I need no charity ,</l>
     <l n="76">For my kind neighbors give me all unasked ,</l>
     <l n="77">And my poor cottage where my fathers dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="78">And where my children and their mother died ,</l>
     <l n="79">Is kept as clean as when sweet Gunga lived ;</l>
     <l n="80">And young and old cheer up my lonely hours ,</l>
     <l n="81">And ask me much of other times and men .</l>
     <l n="82">For when your father 's father was a child ,</l>
     <l n="83">I was a man , as young and strong as you ,</l>
     <l n="84">And my sweet Gunga your companion 's age .</l>
     <l n="85">But O the mystery of life explain !</l>
     <l n="86">Why are we born to tread this little round ,</l>
     <l n="87">To live , to love , to suffer , sorrow , die ?</l>
     <l n="88">Why do the young like field-flowers bloom to fade ?</l>
     <l n="89">Why are the strong like the mown grass cut down ?</l>
     <l n="90">Why am I left as if by death forgot ,</l>
     <l n="91">Left here alone , a leafless , fruitless trunk ?</l>
     <l n="92">Is death the end , or what comes after death ?</l>
     <l n="93">Often when deepest sleep shuts out the world ,</l>
     <l n="94">The dead still seem to live , while life fades out ;</l>
     <l n="95">And when I sit alone and long for light</l>
     <l n="96">The veil seems lifted , and I seem to see</l>
     <l n="97">A world of life and light and peace and rest ,</l>
     <l n="98">No sickness , sin or sorrow , pain or death ,</l>
     <l n="99">No helpless infancy or hopeless age .</l>
     <l n="100">But we poor Sudras cannot understand —</l>
     <l n="101">Yet from my earliest memory I 've heard</l>
     <l n="102">That from this hill one day should burst a light ,</l>
     <l n="103">Not for the Brahmans only , but for all .</l>
     <l n="104">And when you were a child I saw a sage</l>
     <l n="105">Bow down before you , calling you that light .</l>
     <l n="106">O noble , mighty prince ! let your light shine ,</l>

     <l n="108">He spoke , and sank exhausted on the ground .</l>

     <l n="405">With fitful flicker gleamed the lamp of life</l>

     <l n="439">Shrouded the heavens and brooded o'er the earth ,</l>
     <l n="440">Whose rayless , formless , vacant nothingness</l>
     <l n="441">Curdled his blood and made his eyeballs ache ;</l>
     <l n="442">When suddenly from out this empty void</l>
     <l n="443">A cloud , shining with golden light , was borne</l>
     <l n="444">By gentle winds , loaded with sweet perfumes ,</l>
     <l n="445">Sweeter than spring-time on this earth can yield .</l>
     <l n="446">The cloud passed just above him , and he saw</l>
     <l n="447">Myriads of cherub faces looking down ,</l>
     <l n="448">Sweet as Rahula , freed from earthly stain ;</l>
     <l n="449">Such faces mortal brush could never paint —</l>
     <l n="450">Enraptured Raphael ne'er such faces saw .</l>
     <l n="451">But still the outer darkness hovered near ,</l>
     <l n="452">And ever and anon a bony hand</l>
     <l n="453">Darts out to snatch some cherub face away .</l>
     <l n="454">Then dreamed he saw a broad and pleasant land ,</l>
     <l n="455">With cities , gardens , groves and fruitful fields ,</l>
     <l n="456">Where bee-fed flowers half hide the ripening fruits .</l>
     <l n="457">And spicy breezes stir the trembling leaves ,</l>
     <l n="458">And many birds make sweetest melody ,</l>
     <l n="459">But bordered by a valley black as night ,</l>
     <l n="460">That ever vomits from its sunless depths</l>
     <l n="461">Great whirling clouds of suffocating smoke ,</l>
     <l n="462">Blacker than hide the burning Aetna 's head ,</l>
     <l n="463">Blacker than over Lake Avernus hung ;</l>
     <l n="464">No bird could fly above its fatal fumes ;</l>
     <l n="465">Eagles , on tireless pinions upward borne ,</l>
     <l n="466">In widening circles rising toward the sun ,</l>
     <l n="467">Venturing too near its exhalations , fall ,</l>
     <l n="468">As sinks the plummet in the silent sea ;</l>
     <l n="469">And lions , springing on their antlered prey ,</l>
     <l n="470">Drop still and lifeless on its deadly brink ;</l>

     <l n="475">A wind that pierced his marrow parts the clouds ,</l>

     <l n="477">That stood his hair on end , beaded his brow</l>
     <l n="478">With icy drops , and made his blood run cold ;</l>
     <l n="479">He saw a lofty throne , blacker than jet ,</l>
     <l n="480">But shining with a strange and baleful light</l>
     <l n="481">That made him shade his blinded , dazzled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="482">And seated on that throne a ghastly form</l>
     <l n="483">That seemed a giant human skeleton ,</l>
     <l n="484">But yet in motion terrible and quick</l>
     <l n="485">As lightning , killing ere the thunders roll ;</l>
     <l n="486">His fleshless skull had on a seeming crown ,</l>
     <l n="487">While from his sunken sockets glared his eyes</l>
     <l n="488">Like coals of fire or eyes of basilisk ,</l>
     <l n="489">And from his bony hand each instant flew</l>
     <l n="490">Unerring darts that flew to pierce and kill ,</l>
     <l n="491">Piercing the infant in its mother 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="492">The mother when she feels her first-born 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="493">Piercing the father in his happy home ,</l>
     <l n="494">Piercing the lover tasting love 's first kiss ,</l>
     <l n="495">Piercing the vanquished when his banners fall ,</l>
     <l n="496">Piercing the victor ‘ mid triumphant shouts ,</l>
     <l n="497">Piercing the mighty monarch on his throne ;</l>
     <l n="498">While from a towering cypress growing near</l>
     <l n="499">Every disease to which frail flesh is heir</l>
     <l n="500">Like ravening vultures watch each arrow 's flight ,</l>
     <l n="501">And quick as thought glide off on raven 's wings</l>

     <l n="503">As well-trained hunters mark their master 's aim ,</l>
     <l n="504">Then fly to bring the wounded quarry home .</l>
     <l n="505">Meanwhile a stifling stench rose from below —</l>
     <l n="506">As from a battle-field where nations met</l>
     <l n="507">And fiery ranks of living valor fought ,</l>
     <l n="508">Now food for vultures , moldering cold and low —</l>

     <l n="528">Through which the mountains in dim grandeur rise .</l>
     <l n="529">Silent , alone he crossed the maidan wide</l>
     <l n="530">Where first he saw the sweet Yasodhara ,</l>
     <l n="531">Where joyful multitudes so often met ,</l>
     <l n="532">Now still as that dark valley of his dream .</l>
     <l n="533">He passed the lake , mirror of heaven 's high vault ,</l>
     <l n="534">Whose ruffled waters ripple on the shore ,</l>
     <l n="535">Stirred by cool breezes from the snow-capped peaks ;</l>
     <l n="536">And heedless of his way passed on and up ,</l>
     <l n="537">Through giant cedars and the lofty pines ,</l>
     <l n="538">Over a leafy carpet , velvet soft ,</l>
     <l n="539">While solemn voices from their branches sound ,</l>
     <l n="540">Strangely in unison with his sad soul ;</l>
     <l n="541">And on and up until he reached a spot</l>
     <l n="542">Above the trees , above the mist-wrapped world ,</l>
     <l n="543">Where opening chasms yawned on every side .</l>
     <l n="544">Perforce he stopped ; and , roused from revery ,</l>
     <l n="545">Gazed on the dark and silent world below .</l>
     <l n="546">The moon had sunk from sight , the stars grew dim ,</l>
     <l n="547">And densest darkness veiled the sleeping world ,</l>
     <l n="548">When suddenly bright beams of rosy light</l>
     <l n="549">Shot up the east ; the highest mountain-top</l>
     <l n="550">Glittered as if both land and sea had joined</l>
     <l n="551">Their richest jewels and most costly gems</l>
     <l n="552">To make its crown ; from mountain-peak to peak</l>
     <l n="553">The brightness spread , and darkness slunk away ,</l>
     <l n="554">Until between two giant mountain-tops</l>
     <l n="555">Glittered a wedge of gold ; the hills were tinged ,</l>

     <l n="5">Clothed in a yellow robe , simple and coarse ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through unknown streets from door to door he passed ,</l>
     <l n="7">Holding an alms-bowl forth for willing gifts .</l>
     <l n="8">But when , won by his stateliness and grace ,</l>
     <l n="9">They brought their choicest stores , he gently said :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Not so , my friends , keep such for those who need —</l>
     <l n="11">The sick and old ; give me but common food . ”</l>
     <l n="12">And when sufficient for the day was given ,</l>
     <l n="13">He took a way leading without the walls ,</l>
     <l n="14">And through rich gardens , through the fruitful fields ,</l>
     <l n="15">Under dark mangoes and the jujube trees ,</l>
     <l n="16">Eastward toward Sailagiri , hill of gems ;</l>
     <l n="17">And through an ancient grove , skirting its base ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where , soothed by every soft and tranquil sound ,</l>
     <l n="19">Full many saints were wearing out their days</l>
     <l n="20">In meditation , earnest , deep , intent ,</l>
     <l n="21">Seeking to solve the mystery of life ,</l>
     <l n="22">Seeking , by leaving all its joys and cares ,</l>
     <l n="23">Seeking , by doubling all its woes and pains ,</l>
     <l n="24">To gain an entrance to eternal rest ;</l>
     <l n="25">And winding up its rugged sides , to where</l>
     <l n="26">A shoulder of the mountain , sloping west ,</l>
     <l n="27">O'erhangs a cave with wild figs canopied .</l>
     <l n="28">This mountain cave was now his dwelling-place ,</l>
     <l n="29">A stone his pillow , and the earth his bed ,</l>
     <l n="30">His earthen alms-bowl holding all his stores</l>
     <l n="31">Except the crystal waters , murmuring near .</l>
     <l n="32">A lonely path , rugged , and rough , and steep ;</l>
     <l n="33">A lonely cave , its stillness only stirred</l>
     <l n="34">By eagle 's scream , or raven 's solemn croak ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or by the distant city 's softened sounds ,</l>
     <l n="36">Save when a sudden tempest breaks above ,</l>
     <l n="37">And rolling thunders shake the trembling hills —</l>
     <l n="38">A path since worn by countless pilgrims ’ feet ,</l>
     <l n="39">Coming from far to view this hallowed spot ,</l>
     <l n="40">And bow in worship on his hard , cold bed ,</l>
     <l n="41">And press his pillow with their loving lips .</l>
     <l n="42">For here , for six long years , the world-renowned ,</l>
     <l n="43">The tender lover of all living things ,</l>
     <l n="44">Fasted and watched and wrestled for the light ,</l>
     <l n="45">Less for himself than for a weeping world .</l>
     <l n="46">And here arrived , he ate his simple meal ,</l>
     <l n="47">And then in silent meditation sat</l>
     <l n="48">The livelong day , heedless of noon 's fierce heat</l>
     <l n="49">That sent to covert birds and panting beasts ,</l>
     <l n="50">And from the parched and glowing plain sent up ,</l>
     <l n="51">As from a furnace , gusts of scorching air ,</l>
     <l n="52">Through which the city 's walls , the rocks and trees .</l>
     <l n="53">All seemed to tremble , quiver , glow and shake ,</l>
     <l n="54">As if a palsy shook the trembling world ;</l>
     <l n="55">Heedless of loosened rocks that crashed so near ,</l>
     <l n="56">And dashed and thundered to the depths below ,</l>
     <l n="57">And of the shepherds , who with wondering awe</l>
     <l n="58">Came near to gaze upon his noble form</l>
     <l n="59">And gentle , loving but majestic face ,</l>
     <l n="60">And thought some god had deigned to visit men .</l>
     <l n="61">And thus he sat , still as the rock his seat ,</l>
     <l n="62">Seeking to pierce the void from whence man came ,</l>
     <l n="63">To look beyond the veil that shuts him in ,</l>
     <l n="64">To find a clue to life 's dark labyrinth ,</l>
     <l n="65">Seeking to know why man is cast adrift</l>
     <l n="66">Upon the bosom of a troubled sea ,</l>
     <l n="67">His boat so frail , his helm and compass lost ,</l>
     <l n="68">To sink at last in dull oblivion 's depths ;</l>
     <l n="69">When nature seems so perfect and complete ,</l>
     <l n="70">Grand as a whole , and perfect all its parts ,</l>
     <l n="71">Which from the greatest to the least proclaims</l>
     <l n="72">That Wisdom , Watchfulness , and Power and Love</l>
     <l n="73">Which built the mountains , spread the earth abroad ,</l>
     <l n="74">And fixed the bounds that ocean cannot pass ;</l>
     <l n="75">Which taught the seasons their accustomed rounds ,</l>
     <l n="76">Lest seed-time and the happy harvests fail ;</l>
     <l n="77">Which guides the stars in their celestial course ,</l>
     <l n="78">And guides the pigeon 's swift unerring flight</l>
     <l n="79">O'er mountain , sea and plain and desert waste ,</l>
     <l n="80">Straight as an arrow to her distant home ;</l>
     <l n="81">Teaching the ant for winter to prepare ;</l>
     <l n="82">Clothing the lily in its princely pride ;</l>
     <l n="83">Watching the tiny sparrow when it falls ;</l>
     <l n="84">Nothing too great for His almighty arm ;</l>
     <l n="85">Nothing too small for His all-seeing eye ;</l>
     <l n="86">Nothing too mean for His paternal care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="87">And thus he mused , seeking to find a light</l>
     <l n="88">To guide men on their dark and weary way ,</l>
     <l n="89">And through the valley and the shades of death ,</l>
     <l n="90">Until the glories of the setting sun</l>
     <l n="91">Called him to vespers and his evening meal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="92">Then roused from revery , ablutions made ,</l>
     <l n="93">Eight times he bowed , just as the setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="94">A fiery red , sunk slowly out of sight</l>
     <l n="95">Beyond the western plains , gilded and tinged ,</l>
     <l n="96">Misty and vast , beneath a brilliant sky ,</l>
     <l n="97">Shaded from brightest gold to softest rose .</l>
     <l n="98">Then , after supper , back and forth he paced</l>
     <l n="99">Upon the narrow rock before his cave ,</l>
     <l n="100">Seeking to ease his numbed and stiffened limbs ;</l>
     <l n="101">While evening 's sombre shadows slowly crept</l>
     <l n="102">From plain to hill and highest mountain-top ,</l>
     <l n="103">And solemn silence settled on the world ,</l>
     <l n="104">Save for the night-jar 's cry and owl 's complaint ;</l>
     <l n="105">While many lights from out the city gleam ,</l>
     <l n="106">And thickening stars spangle the azure vault ,</l>
     <l n="107">Until the moon , with soft and silvery light ,</l>
     <l n="108">Half veils and half reveals the sleeping world .</l>
     <l n="109">And then he slept — for weary souls must sleep ,</l>
     <l n="110">As well as bodies worn with daily toil ;</l>
     <l n="111">And as he lay stretched on his hard , cold bed ,</l>
     <l n="112">His youthful blood again bounds freely on ,</l>
     <l n="113">Repairing wastes the weary day had made .</l>
     <l n="114">And then he dreamed . Sometimes he dreamed of home ,</l>
     <l n="115">Of young Rahula , reaching out his arms ,</l>
     <l n="116">Of sweet Yasodhara with loving words</l>
     <l n="117">Cheering him on , as love alone can cheer .</l>
     <l n="118">Sometimes he dreamed he saw that living light</l>
     <l n="119">For which his earnest soul so long had yearned —</l>
     <l n="120">But over hills and mountains far away .</l>
     <l n="121">And then he seemed with labored steps to climb</l>
     <l n="122">Down giddy cliffs , far harder than ascent ,</l>
     <l n="123">While yawning chasms threatened to devour ,</l>
     <l n="124">And beetling cliffs precluded all retreat ;</l>
     <l n="125">But still the way seemed opening step by step ,</l>
     <l n="126">Until he reached the valley 's lowest depths ,</l>
     <l n="127">Where twilight reigned , and grim and ghastly forms ,</l>
     <l n="128">With flaming swords , obstruct his onward way ,</l>
     <l n="129">But his all-conquering love still urged him on ,</l>
     <l n="130">When with wild shrieks they vanished in thin air ;</l>
     <l n="131">And then he climbed , clinging to jutting cliffs ,</l>
     <l n="132">And stunted trees that from each crevice grew ,</l>
     <l n="133">Till weary , breathless , he regained the heights ,</l>
     <l n="134">To see that light nearer , but still so far .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="135">And thus he slept , and thus sometimes he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="136">But rose before the dawn had tinged the east ,</l>
     <l n="137">Before the jungle-cock had made his call ,</l>
     <l n="138">When thoughts are clearest , and the world is still ,</l>
     <l n="139">Refreshed and strengthened for his daily search</l>
     <l n="140">Into the seeds of sorrow , germs of pain ,</l>
     <l n="141">After a light to scatter doubts and fears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="142">But when the coming day silvered the east ,</l>
     <l n="143">And warmed that silver into softest gold ,</l>
     <l n="144">And faintest rose-tints tinged the passing clouds ,</l>
     <l n="145">He , as the Vedas taught , each morning bathed</l>
     <l n="146">In the clear stream that murmured near his cave ,</l>
     <l n="147">Then bowed in reverence to the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="148">As from behind the glittering mountain-peaks</l>
     <l n="149">It burst in glory on the waking world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="150">Then bowl and staff in hand , he took his way</l>
     <l n="151">Along his mountain-path and through the grove ,</l>
     <l n="152">And through the gardens , through the fruitful fields ,</l>
     <l n="153">Down to the city , for his daily alms ;</l>
     <l n="154">While children his expected coming watch ,</l>
     <l n="155">And running cry : “ The gracious Rishi comes . ”</l>
     <l n="156">All gladly gave , and soon his bowl was filled ,</l>
     <l n="157">For he repaid their gifts with gracious thanks ,</l>
     <l n="158">And his unbounded love , clearer than words ,</l>
     <l n="159">Spoke to their hearts as he passed gently on .</l>
     <l n="160">Even stolid plowmen after him would look ,</l>
     <l n="161">Wondering that one so stately and so grand</l>
     <l n="162">Should even for them have kind and gracious words ,</l>
     <l n="163">Sometimes while passing through the sacred grove ,</l>
     <l n="164">He paused beneath an aged banyan-tree ,</l>
     <l n="165">Whose spreading branches drooping down took root</l>
     <l n="166">To grow again in other giant trunks ,</l>
     <l n="167">An ever-widening , ever-deepening shade ,</l>
     <l n="168">Where five , like him in manhood 's early prime ,</l>
     <l n="169">Each bound to life by all its tender ties ,</l>
     <l n="170">High born and rich , had left their happy homes ,</l>
     <l n="171">Their only food chance-gathered day by day ,</l>
     <l n="172">Their only roof this spreading banyan-tree ;</l>
     <l n="173">And there long time they earnestly communed ,</l>
     <l n="174">Seeking to aid each other in the search</l>
     <l n="175">For higher life and for a clearer light .</l>
     <l n="176">And here , under a sacred peepul 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="177">Two Brahmans , famed for sanctity , had dwelt</l>
     <l n="178">For many years , all cares of life cast off ,</l>
     <l n="179">Who by long fastings sought to make the veil</l>
     <l n="180">Of flesh translucent to the inner eye ;</l>
     <l n="181">Eyes fixed intently on the nose 's tip ,</l>
     <l n="182">To lose all consciousness of outward things ;</l>
     <l n="183">By breath suppressed to still the outer pulse ,</l>
     <l n="184">So that the soul might wake to conscious life ,</l>
     <l n="185">And on unfolded wings unchecked might rise .</l>
     <l n="186">And in the purest auras freely soar ,</l>
     <l n="187">Above cross-currents that engender clouds</l>
     <l n="188">Where thunders roll , and quick cross-lightnings play ,</l>
     <l n="189">To view the world of causes and of life ,</l>
     <l n="190">And bathe in light that knows no night , no change .</l>
     <l n="191">With eager questionings he sought to learn ,</l>
     <l n="192">While they with gentle answers gladly taught</l>
     <l n="193">All that their self-denying search had learned .</l>
     <l n="194">And thus he passed his days and months and years ,</l>
     <l n="195">In constant , patient , earnest search for light ,</l>
     <l n="196">With longer fastings and more earnest search ,</l>
     <l n="197">While day by day his body frailer grew ,</l>
     <l n="198">Until his soul , loosed from its earthly bonds ,</l>
     <l n="199">Sometimes escaped its narrow prison-house ,</l>
     <l n="200">And like the lark to heaven 's gate it soared ,</l>
     <l n="201">To view the glories of the coming dawn .</l>
     <l n="202">But as he rose , the sad and sorrowing world ,</l>
     <l n="203">For which his soul with tender love had yearned ,</l>
     <l n="204">Seemed deeper in the nether darkness sunk ,</l>
     <l n="205">Beyond his reach , beyond his power to save ,</l>
     <l n="206">When sadly to his prison-house he turned ,</l>
     <l n="207">Wishing no light that did not shine for all .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="208">Six years had passed , six long and weary years ,</l>

     <l n="210">Knowledge he found , knowledge that soared aloft</l>
     <l n="211">To giddy heights , and sounded hidden depths ,</l>
     <l n="212">Secrets of knowledge that the Brahmans taught</l>
     <l n="213">The favored few , but far beyond the reach</l>
     <l n="214">Of those who toil and weep and cry for help ;</l>

     <l n="227">Shone through the cave , and all was dark again .</l>
     <l n="228">Startled he rose , then prostrate in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="229">His inmost soul breathed forth an earnest prayer<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>

     <l n="303">While all the people drew aside to gaze</l>
     <l n="304">Upon his gentle but majestic face ,</l>
     <l n="305">Beaming with tender , all-embracing love .</l>
     <l n="306">And when the king and royal train dismount ,</l>
     <l n="307">‘ Mid prostrate people and the stately priests ,</l>
     <l n="308">On fragrant flowers that carpeted his way ,</l>
     <l n="309">And mount the lofty steps to reach the shrine ,</l>
     <l n="310">Siddartha came , upon the other side ,</l>
     <l n="311">‘ Mid stalls for victims , sheds for sacred wood ,</l>
     <l n="312">And rude attendants on the pompous rites ,</l>
     <l n="313">Who seized a goat , the patriarch of the flock ,</l>
     <l n="314">And bound him firm with sacred munja grass ,</l>
     <l n="315">And bore aloft , while Buddha followed where</l>
     <l n="316">A priest before the blazing altar stood</l>
     <l n="317">With glittering knife , and others fed the fires ,</l>
     <l n="318">While clouds of incense from the altar rose ,</l>
     <l n="319">Sweeter than Araby the blest can yield ,</l>
     <l n="320">And white-robed Brahmans chant their sacred hymns .</l>
     <l n="321">And there before that ancient shrine they met ,</l>
     <l n="322">The king , the priests , the hermit from the hill ,</l>
     <l n="323">When one , an aged Brahman , raised his hands ,</l>
     <l n="324">And praying , lifted up his voice and cried :</l>
     <l n="325">“ O hear ! great Indra , from thy lofty throne</l>
     <l n="326">On Meru 's holy mountain , high in heaven .</l>
     <l n="327">Let every good the king has ever done</l>
     <l n="328">With this sweet incense mingled rise to thee ;</l>
     <l n="329">And every secret , every open sin</l>
     <l n="330">Be laid upon this goat , to sink from sight ,</l>
     <l n="331">Drunk by the earth with his hot spouting blood ,</l>
     <l n="332">Or on this altar with his flesh be burned . ”</l>
     <l n="333">And all the Brahman choir responsive cried :</l>
     <l n="334">“ Long live the king ! now let the victim die ! ”</l>
     <l n="335">But Buddha said : “ Let him not strike , O king !</l>
     <l n="336">For how can God , being good , delight in blood ?</l>
     <l n="337">And how can blood wash out the stains of sin ,</l>
     <l n="338">And change the fixed eternal law of life</l>
     <l n="339">That good from good , evil from evil flows ? ”</l>
     <l n="340">This said , he stooped and loosed the panting goat ,</l>
     <l n="341">None staying him , so great his presence was .</l>
     <l n="342">And then with loving tenderness he taught</l>
     <l n="343">How sin works out its own sure punishment ;</l>
     <l n="344">How like corroding rust and eating moth</l>
     <l n="345">It wastes the very substance of the soul ;</l>
     <l n="346">Like poisoned blood it surely , drop by drop ,</l>
     <l n="347">Pollutes the very fountain of the life ;</l>
     <l n="348">Like deadly drug it changes into stone</l>
     <l n="349">The living fibres of a loving heart ;</l>
     <l n="350">Like fell disease , it breeds within the veins</l>
     <l n="351">The living agents of a living death ;</l>
     <l n="352">And as in gardens overgrown with weeds ,</l>
     <l n="353">Nothing but patient labor , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="354">Uprooting cherished evils one by one ,</l>
     <l n="355">Watering its soil with penitential tears ,</l>
     <l n="356">Can fit the soul to grow that precious seed ,</l>
     <l n="357">Which taking root , spreads out a grateful shade</l>
     <l n="358">Where gentle thoughts like singing birds may lodge ,</l>
     <l n="359">Where pure desires like fragrant flowers may bloom ,</l>
     <l n="360">And loving acts like ripened fruits may hang .</l>
     <l n="361">Then , chiding not , with earnest words he urged</l>
     <l n="362">Humanity to man , kindness to beasts ,</l>
     <l n="363">Pure words , kind acts , in all our daily walks .</l>
     <l n="364">As better than the blood of lambs and goats .</l>
     <l n="365">Better than incense or the chanted hymn ,</l>
     <l n="366">To cleanse the heart and please the powers above ,</l>
     <l n="367">And fill the world with harmony and peace ,</l>
     <l n="368">Till pricked in heart , the priest let fall his knife ;</l>
     <l n="369">The Brahmans listening , ceased to chant their hymns ;</l>
     <l n="370">The king drank in his words with eager ears ;</l>
     <l n="371">And from that day no altar dripped with blood ,</l>
     <l n="372">But flowers instead breathed forth their sweet perfumes .</l>
     <l n="373">And when that troubled day drew near its close ,</l>
     <l n="374">Joy filled once more that shepherd 's humble home ,</l>
     <l n="375">From door to door his simple story flew ,</l>
     <l n="376">And when the king entered his palace gates ,</l>
     <l n="377">New thoughts were surging in his wakened soul .</l>

     <l n="383">Heedless of food , his alms-bowl hung unused .</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>I am aware there are many who think that Buddha did not believe in prayer , which Arnold puts into his own mouth in these words , which sound like the clanking of chains in a prison-vault :</p>

     <l n="2">Nought from Silence , for it cannot speak ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Buddha did teach that mere prayers without any effort to overcome our evils is of no more use than for a merchant to pray the farther bank of a swollen stream to come to him without seeking any means to cross , which merely differs in words from the declaration of St. James that faith without works is dead ; but if he ever taught that the earnest yearning of a soul for help , which is the essence of prayer , is no aid in the struggle for a higher life , then my whole reading has been at fault , and the whole Buddhist worship has been a departure from the teachings of its founder .</p>

     <l n="4">Seeking to lead his steady steps astray</l>

     <l n="11">Knowledge of ages past and yet to come ,</l>
     <l n="12">Knowledge of nature and the hidden laws</l>

     <l n="18">In sin and sorrow groping blindly on .</l>
     <l n="19">But when he saw that lust of power moved not ,</l>
     <l n="20">And thirst for knowledge turned him not aside</l>
     <l n="21">From earnest search after the living light ,</l>
     <l n="22">From tender love for every living thing ,</l>
     <l n="23">He sent the tempters Doubt and dark Despair .</l>
     <l n="24">And as he watched for final victory</l>
     <l n="25">He saw that light flash through the silent cave ,</l>
     <l n="26">And heard the Buddha breathe that earnest prayer ,</l>
     <l n="27">And fled amazed , nor dared to look behind .</l>
     <l n="28">For though to Buddha all his way seemed dark ,</l>
     <l n="29">His wily enemy could see a Power ,</l>
     <l n="30">A mighty Power , that ever hovered near ,</l>
     <l n="31">A present help in every time of need ,</l>
     <l n="32">When sinking souls seek earnestly for aid .</l>
     <l n="33">He fled , indeed , as flies the prowling wolf ,</l>
     <l n="34">Alarmed at watch-dog 's bark or shepherd 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="35">While seeking entrance to the slumbering fold ,</l>
     <l n="36">But soon returns with soft and stealthy step ,</l>
     <l n="37">With keenest scent snuffing the passing breeze ,</l>
     <l n="38">With ears erect catching each slightest sound ,</l>
     <l n="39">With glaring eyes watching each moving thing ,</l>
     <l n="40">With hungry jaws , skulking about the fold</l>
     <l n="41">Till coming dawn drives him to seek his lair .</l>
     <l n="42">So Mara fled , and so he soon returned ,</l>
     <l n="43">And thus he watched the Buddha 's every step ;</l>
     <l n="44">Saw him with gentleness quell haughty power ;</l>
     <l n="45">Saw him with tenderness raise up the weak ;</l>
     <l n="46">Heard him before the Brahmans and the king</l>
     <l n="47">Denounce those bloody rites ordained by him ;</l>
     <l n="48">Heard him declare the deadly work of Sin ,</l>
     <l n="49">His own prime minister and eldest-born ;</l>
     <l n="50">Heard him proclaim the mighty power of Love</l>
     <l n="51">To cleanse the life and make the flinty heart</l>
     <l n="52">As soft as sinews of the new-born babe .</l>
     <l n="53">And when he saw whither he bent his steps ,</l>
     <l n="54">He sent three wrinkled hags , deformed and foul ,</l>
     <l n="55">The willing agents of his wicked will —</l>
     <l n="56">Life-wasting Idleness , the thief of time ;</l>

     <l n="426">That leads to purity and peace and life .</l>
     <l n="427">But helping hands will aid those struggling up ;</l>
     <l n="428">A warning voice may check those hasting down .</l>
     <l n="429">Men are like lilies in yon shining pool :</l>
     <l n="430">Some sunk in evil grovel in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="431">Loving like swine to wallow in the mire —</l>
     <l n="432">Like those that grow within its silent depths ,</l>
     <l n="433">Scarce raised above its black and oozy bed ;</l>
     <l n="434">While some love good , and seek the purest light ,</l>
     <l n="435">Breathing sweet fragrance from their gentle lives —</l>
     <l n="436">Like those that rise above its glassy face ,</l>
     <l n="437">Sparkling with dewdrops , royally arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="438">Drinking the brightness of the morning sun ,</l>
     <l n="439">Distilling odors through the balmy air ;</l>
     <l n="440">But countless multitudes grope blindly on ,</l>
     <l n="441">Shut out from light and crushed by cruel castes ,</l>
     <l n="442">Willing to learn , whom none will deign to teach ,</l>
     <l n="443">Willing to rise , whom none will deign to guide ,</l>
     <l n="444">Who from the cradle to the silent grave ,</l>
     <l n="445">Helpless and hopeless , only toil and weep —</l>
     <l n="446">Like those that on the stagnant waters float ,</l>
     <l n="447">Smothered with leaves , covered with ropy slime ,</l>
     <l n="448">That from the rosy dawn to dewy eve</l>
     <l n="449">Scarce catch one glimmer of the glorious sun .</l>
     <l n="450">The good scarce need , the bad will scorn , my aid ;</l>
     <l n="451">But these poor souls will gladly welcome help .</l>
     <l n="452">Welcome to me the scorn of rich and great ,</l>
     <l n="453">Welcome the Brahman 's proud and cold disdain ,</l>
     <l n="454">Welcome revilings from the rabble rout ,</l>
     <l n="455">If I can lead some groping souls to light —</l>
     <l n="456">If I can give some weary spirits rest .</l>
     <l n="457">Farewell , my brother , you have earned release —</l>
     <l n="458">Rest here in peace . I go to aid the poor . ”</l>
     <l n="459">And as he spoke a flash of lurid light</l>
     <l n="460">Shot through the air , and Buddha stood alone —</l>
     <l n="461">Alone ! to teach the warring nations peace !</l>
     <l n="462">Alone ! to lead a groping world to light !</l>
     <l n="463">Alone ! to give the heavy-laden rest !</l>

     <l n="3">Of open vision of that blissful world ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of sweet communion with those dwelling there .</l>
     <l n="5">But having tasted , seen and felt the joys</l>
     <l n="6">Of that bright world where love is all in all ,</l>
     <l n="7">Filling each heart , inspiring every thought ,</l>
     <l n="8">Guiding each will and prompting every act ,</l>
     <l n="9">He yearned to see the other , darker side</l>
     <l n="10">Of that bright picture , where the wars and hates ,</l>
     <l n="11">The lust , the greed , the cruelty and crime</l>
     <l n="12">That fill the world with pain and want and woe</l>

     <l n="19">Led by his guides he reached Nirvana 's verge ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whence he beheld a broad and pleasant plain ,</l>
     <l n="21">Spread with a carpet of the richest green</l>
     <l n="22">And decked with flowers of every varied tint ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whose blended odors fill the balmy air ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where trees , pleasant to sight and good for food ,</l>
     <l n="25">In rich abundance and spontaneous grow .</l>
     <l n="26">A living stream , as purest crystal clear ,</l>
     <l n="27">With gentle murmurs wound along the plain ,</l>
     <l n="28">Its surface bright with fairer lotus-flowers</l>
     <l n="29">Than mortal eye on earth had ever seen ,</l>
     <l n="30">While on its banks were cool , umbrageous groves</l>
     <l n="31">Whose drooping branches spicy breezes stir ,</l>
     <l n="32">A singing bird in every waving bough ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whose joyful notes the soul of music shed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="34">A mighty multitude , beyond the power</l>
     <l n="35">Of men to number , moved about the plain ;</l>
     <l n="36">Some , seeming strangers , wander through the groves</l>
     <l n="37">And pluck the flowers or eat the luscious fruits ;</l>
     <l n="38">Some , seeming visitors from better worlds ,</l>
     <l n="39">Here wait and watch as for expected guests ;</l>
     <l n="40">While angel devas , clothed in innocence ,</l>
     <l n="41">Whose faces beam with wisdom , glow with love ,</l>
     <l n="42">With loving welcomes greet each coming guest ,</l>
     <l n="43">With loving counsels aid , instruct and guide .</l>
     <l n="44">And as he looked , the countless , restless throng</l>
     <l n="45">Seemed ever changing , ever moving on ,</l>
     <l n="46">So that this plain , comparing great to small ,</l>
     <l n="47">Seemed like a station near some royal town ,</l>
     <l n="48">Greater than London or old Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="49">Where all the roads from some vast empire meet ,</l>
     <l n="50">And many caravans or sweeping trains</l>
     <l n="51">Bring and remove the ever-changing throng .</l>
     <l n="52">This plain a valley bordered , deep and still ,</l>
     <l n="53">The very valley of his fearful dream</l>
     <l n="54">Seen from the other side , whose rising mists</l>
     <l n="55">Were all aglow with ever-changing light ,</l>
     <l n="56">Like passing clouds above the setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="57">Through which as through a glass he darkly saw</l>
     <l n="58">Unnumbered funeral-trains , in sable clad ,</l>
     <l n="59">To solemn music and with measured tread</l>
     <l n="60">Bearing their dead to countless funeral-piles ,</l>
     <l n="61">As thick as heaps that through the livelong day</l>
     <l n="62">With patient toil the sturdy woodmen rear ,</l>
     <l n="63">While clearing forests for the golden grain ,</l>
     <l n="64">And set aflame when evening 's shades descend ,</l>
     <l n="65">Filling the glowing woods with floods of light</l>
     <l n="66">And ghostly shadows : So these funeral-piles</l>

     <l n="74">To blare of trumpet , sound of shell and drum ,</l>
     <l n="75">While many mourners bow in silent grief ,</l>
     <l n="76">And widows , orphans raise a loud lament</l>
     <l n="77">As for a father , a protector lost ;</l>
     <l n="78">And as the flames lick up the fragrant oils ,</l>
     <l n="79">And whirl and hiss around that wasting form ,</l>
     <l n="80">An eager watcher from a better world</l>

     <l n="82">The cumbrous load of pomp and power cast off ,</l>
     <l n="83">While waiting devas and the happy throng</l>

     <l n="87">Where all his stores of duties well performed ,</l>
     <l n="88">Of power well used and wealth in kindness given ,</l>
     <l n="89">Were garnered up beyond the reach of thieves ,</l>

     <l n="172">The time for pleasure , when all pleasures please ;</l>
     <l n="173">Manhood , the time for gaining wealth and power ;</l>

     <l n="207">The fire of love , consuming lust and hate</l>
     <l n="208">As forest fires devour the crackling thorns ,</l>

     <l n="467">The sign and sealing of their gift of love</l>
     <l n="468">Of this vihara , Gatavana called ,</l>
     <l n="469">A school and rest-house for the Buddha 's use ,</l>
     <l n="470">And for the brotherhood throughout the world .</l>
     <l n="471">Buddha received it with the fervent prayer</l>
     <l n="472">That it might give the kingdom lasting peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="473">Unlike Sudata 's self , Sudata 's king</l>
     <l n="474">Believed religion but a comely cloak</l>
     <l n="475">To hide besetting sins from public view ,</l>
     <l n="476">And sought the master in his new retreat</l>
     <l n="477">To talk religion and to act a part ,</l>
     <l n="478">And greetings ended , said in solemn wise :</l>
     <l n="479">“ Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown ;</l>
     <l n="480">But my poor kingdom now is doubly blest</l>
     <l n="481">In one whose teachings purify the soul</l>
     <l n="482">And give the highest and the humblest rest ,</l>
     <l n="483">As all are cleansed who bathe in Rapti 's stream . ”</l>
     <l n="484">But Buddha saw through all this outer show</l>
     <l n="485">His real purposes and inner life :</l>
     <l n="486">The love of pleasure blighting high resolve ,</l>
     <l n="487">The love of money , root of every ill ,</l>
     <l n="488">That sends its poison fibers through the soul</l>
     <l n="489">And saps its life and wastes its vital strength .</l>
     <l n="490">“ The Tathagata only shows the way</l>
     <l n="491">To purity and rest , ” the master said .</l>
     <l n="492">“ There is a way to darkness out of light ,</l>
     <l n="493">There is a way to light from deepest gloom .</l>
     <l n="494">They only gain the goal who keep the way .</l>
     <l n="495">Harsh words and evil deeds to sorrow lead</l>
     <l n="496">As sure as shadows on their substance wait .</l>
     <l n="497">For as we sow , so also shall we reap .</l>
     <l n="498">Boast not overmuch of kingly dignity .</l>
     <l n="499">A king most needs a kind and loving heart</l>
     <l n="500">To love his subjects as an only son ,</l>
     <l n="501">To aid — not injure , comfort — not oppress ,</l>
     <l n="502">Their help , protector , father , friend and guide .</l>
     <l n="503">Such kings shall live beloved and die renowned ,</l>
     <l n="504">Whose works shall welcome them to heavenly rest . ”</l>
     <l n="505">The king , convicted , heard his solemn words</l>
     <l n="506">That like an arrow pierced his inmost life .</l>
     <l n="507">To him religion ceased to be a show</l>
     <l n="508">Of chants and incense , empty forms and creeds ,</l>
     <l n="509">But stood a living presence in his way</l>
     <l n="510">To check his blind and headlong downward course ,</l>
     <l n="511">And lead him to the noble eightfold path ,</l>
     <l n="512">That day by day and step by step shall lead</l>
     <l n="513">To purity and peace and heavenly rest .</l>

     <l n="596">He gently raised and pressed her to his heart</l>
     <l n="597">In one most tender , loving , long embrace .</l>
     <l n="598">By that embrace her every heartache cured ,</l>
     <l n="599">She calmly said : “ Give me a humble part</l>

     <l n="607">And in a higher presence , who can doubt</l>
     <l n="608">He made her first of that great sisterhood ,</l>
     <l n="609">Since through the ages known in every land ,</l>

     <l n="650">But love for them drove me to leave my home .</l>
     <l n="651">The greatest kingdoms are like ocean 's foam ,</l>
     <l n="652">A moment white upon the crested wave .</l>
     <l n="653">The longest life is but a passing dream ,</l>

     <l n="655">But these poor souls shall live in joy or woe</l>
     <l n="656">While nations rise and fall and kalpas pass ,</l>
     <l n="657">And this proud city crumbles to decay</l>

     <l n="660">Not for the pleasures of a passing day ,</l>
     <l n="661">Like shadows flitting ere you point their place ,</l>

     <l n="666">And then he showed the noble eightfold path</l>

     <l n="669">Whose face , beaming with pure , unselfish love ,</l>
     <l n="670">Transfigured seemed ; and many noble youth ,</l>
     <l n="671">And chief Ananda , the Beloved called ,</l>
     <l n="672">Forsook their gay companions and the round</l>
