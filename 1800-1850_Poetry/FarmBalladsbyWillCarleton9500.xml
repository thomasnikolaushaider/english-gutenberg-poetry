   </titlePage>
   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">These poems have been written under various , and , in some cases , difficult , conditions : in the open air , “ with team afield ; ” in the student 's den , with the ghosts of unfinished lessons hovering gloomily about ; amid the rush and roar of railroad travel , which trains of thought are not prone to follow ; and in the editor 's sanctum , where the dainty feet of the Muses do not often deign to tread .</p>
    <p n="2">Crude and unfinished as they are , the author has yet had the assurance to publish them , from time to time , in different periodicals , in which , it is but just to admit , they have been met by the people with unexpected favor . While his judgment has often failed to endorse the kind words spoken for them , he has naturally not felt it in his heart to file any remonstrances .</p>
    <p n="3">He has been asked , by friends in all parts of the country , to put his poems into a more durable form than they have hitherto possessed ; and it is in accordance with these requests that he now presents “ Farm Ballads ” to the public .</p>
    <p n="4">Of course he does not expect to escape , what he needs so greatly , the discipline of severe criticism ; for he is aware that he has often wandered out of the beaten track , and has many times been too regardless of the established rules of rhythm , in his ( oftentimes vain ) search for the flowers of poesy .</p>
    <p n="5">But he believes that The People are , after all , the true critics , and will soon ascertain whether there are more good than poor things in a book ; and whatever may be their verdict in this case , he has made up his mind to be happy . W. C .</p>

      <head>BETSEY AND I ARE OUT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Draw up the papers , lawyer , and make ‘ em good and stout ;</l>
       <l n="2">For things at home are crossways , and Betsey and I are out .</l>
       <l n="3">We , who have worked together so long as man and wife ,</l>
       <l n="4">Must pull in single harness for the rest of our nat'ral life .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">“ What is the matter ? ” say you . I swan it 's hard to tell !</l>
       <l n="6">Most of the years behind us we 've passed by very well ;</l>
       <l n="7">I have no other woman , she has no other man —</l>
       <l n="8">Only we 've lived together as long as we ever can .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">So I have talked with Betsey , and Betsey has talked with me ,</l>
       <l n="10">And so we 've agreed together that we can n't never agree ;</l>
       <l n="11">Not that we 've catched each other in any terrible crime ;</l>
       <l n="12">We 've been a-gathering this for years , a little at a time .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">There was a stock of temper we both had for a start ,</l>
       <l n="14">Although we never suspected ‘ twould take us two apart ;</l>
       <l n="15">I had my various failings , bred in the flesh and bone ;</l>
       <l n="16">And Betsey , like all good women , had a temper of her own .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">The first thing I remember whereon we disagreed</l>
       <l n="18">Was something concerning heaven — a difference in our creed ;</l>
       <l n="19">We arg'ed the thing at breakfast , we arg'ed the thing at tea ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the more we arg'ed the question the more we did n't agree .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">And the next that I remember was when we lost a cow ;</l>
       <l n="22">She had kicked the bucket for certain , the question was only — How ?</l>
       <l n="23">I held my own opinion , and Betsey another had ;</l>
       <l n="24">And when we were done a-talkin ’ , we both of us was mad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">And the next that I remember , it started in a joke ;</l>
       <l n="26">But full for a week it lasted , and neither of us spoke .</l>
       <l n="27">And the next was when I scolded because she broke a bowl ;</l>
       <l n="28">And she said I was mean and stingy , and had n't any soul .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">And so that bowl kept pourin ’ dissensions in our cup ;</l>
       <l n="30">And so that blamed cow-critter was always a-comin ’ up ;</l>
       <l n="31">And so that heaven we arg'ed no nearer to us got ,</l>
       <l n="32">But it gave us a taste of somethin ’ a thousand times as hot .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">And so the thing kept workin ’ , and all the self-same way ;</l>
       <l n="34">Always somethin ’ to arg'e , and somethin ’ sharp to say ;</l>
       <l n="35">And down on us came the neighbors , a couple dozen strong ,</l>
       <l n="36">And lent their kindest sarvice for to help the thing along .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">And there has been days together — and many a weary week —</l>
       <l n="38">We was both of us cross and spunky , and both too proud to speak ;</l>
       <l n="39">And I have been thinkin ’ and thinkin ’ , the whole of the winter and fall ,</l>
       <l n="40">If I can n't live kind with a woman , why , then , I wo n't at all .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">And so I have talked with Betsey , and Betsey has talked with me ,</l>
       <l n="42">And we have agreed together that we can n't never agree ;</l>
       <l n="43">And what is hers shall be hers , and what is mine shall be mine ;</l>
       <l n="44">And I 'll put it in the agreement , and take it to her to sign .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">Write on the paper , lawyer — the very first paragraph —</l>
       <l n="46">Of all the farm and live-stock that she shall have her half ;</l>
       <l n="47">For she has helped to earn it , through many a weary day ,</l>
       <l n="48">And it 's nothing more than justice that Betsey has her pay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">Give her the house and homestead — a man can thrive and roam ;</l>
       <l n="50">But women are skeery critters , unless they have a home ;</l>
       <l n="51">And I have always determined , and never failed to say ,</l>
       <l n="52">That Betsey never should want a home if I was taken away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">There is a little hard money that 's drawin ’ tol'rable pay :</l>
       <l n="54">A couple of hundred dollars laid by for a rainy day ;</l>
       <l n="55">Safe in the hands of good men , and easy to get at ;</l>
       <l n="56">Put in another clause there , and give her half of that .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">Yes , I see you smile , Sir , at my givin ’ her so much ;</l>
       <l n="58">Yes , divorce is cheap , Sir , but I take no stock in such !</l>
       <l n="59">True and fair I married her , when she was blithe and young ;</l>
       <l n="60">And Betsey was al'ays good to me , exceptin ’ with her tongue .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="61">[ image not found : CarleFarmB-19 , CarleFarmB-19 ]</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="62">Once , when I was young as you , and not so smart , perhaps ,</l>
       <l n="63">For me she mittened a lawyer , and several other chaps ;</l>
       <l n="64">And all of them was flustered , and fairly taken down ,</l>
       <l n="65">And I for a time was counted the luckiest man in town .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="66">Once when I had a fever — I wo n't forget it soon —</l>
       <l n="67">I was hot as a basted turkey and crazy as a loon ;</l>
       <l n="68">Never an hour went by me when she was out of sight —</l>
       <l n="69">She nursed me true and tender , and stuck to me day and night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="70">And if ever a house was tidy , and ever a kitchen clean ,</l>
       <l n="71">Her house and kitchen was tidy as any I ever seen ;</l>
       <l n="72">And I do n't complain of Betsey , or any of her acts ,</l>
       <l n="73">Exceptin ’ when we 've quarreled , and told each other facts .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="74">So draw up the paper , lawyer , and I 'll go home to-night ,</l>
       <l n="75">And read the agreement to her , and see if it 's all right ;</l>
       <l n="76">And then , in the mornin ’ , I 'll sell to a tradin ’ man I know ,</l>
       <l n="77">And kiss the child that was left to us , and out in the world I 'll go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="78">And one thing put in the paper , that first to me did n't occur :</l>
       <l n="79">That when I am dead at last she 'll bring me back to her ;</l>
       <l n="80">And lay me under the maples I planted years ago ,</l>
       <l n="81">When she and I was happy before we quarreled so .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="82">And when she dies I wish that she would be laid by me ,</l>
       <l n="83">And , lyin ’ together in silence , perhaps we will agree ;</l>
       <l n="84">And , if ever we meet in heaven , I would n't think it queer</l>
       <l n="85">If we loved each other the better because we quarreled here .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">You drew up that paper — I s'pose you want your pay .</l>
       <l n="4">Do n't cut down your figures ; make it an X or a V ;</l>
       <l n="5">For that ‘ ere written agreement was just the makin ’ of me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">Goin ’ home that evenin ’ I tell you I was blue ,</l>
       <l n="7">Thinkin ’ of all my troubles , and what I was goin ’ to do ;</l>
       <l n="8">And if my hosses had n't been the steadiest team alive ,</l>
       <l n="9">They 'd ‘ ve tipped me over , certain , for I could n't see where to drive .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="10">No — for I was laborin ’ under a heavy load ;</l>
       <l n="11">No — for I was travelin ’ an entirely different road ;</l>
       <l n="12">For I was a-tracin ’ over the path of our lives ag'in ,</l>
       <l n="13">And seein ’ where we missed the way , and where we might have been .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="14">And many a corner we 'd turned that just to a quarrel led ,</l>
       <l n="15">When I ought to ‘ ve held my temper , and driven straight ahead ;</l>
       <l n="16">And the more I thought it over the more these memories came ,</l>
       <l n="17">And the more I struck the opinion that I was the most to blame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="18">And things I had long forgotten kept risin ’ in my mind ,</l>
       <l n="19">Of little matters betwixt us , where Betsey was good and kind ;</l>
       <l n="20">And these things flashed all through me , as you know things</l>
       <l n="21">sometimes will</l>
       <l n="22">When a feller 's alone in the darkness , and every thing is still .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="23">“ But , ” says I , “ we 're too far along to take another track ,</l>

       <l n="25">And ‘ tai n't an uncommon thing now for couples to smash in two ; ”</l>
       <l n="26">And so I set my teeth together , and vowed I 'd see it through .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="32">And when I went in the house the table was set for me —</l>

       <l n="34">And I crammed the agreement down my pocket as well as I could ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">

       <l n="41">And when I 'd done my supper I drawed the agreement out ,</l>
       <l n="42">And give it to her without a word , for she knowed what ‘ twas about ;</l>
       <l n="43">And then I hummed a little tune , but now and then a note</l>
       <l n="44">Was bu'sted by some animal that hopped up in my throat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="45">Then Betsey she got her specs from off the mantel-shelf ,</l>
       <l n="46">And read the article over quite softly to herself ;</l>
       <l n="47">Read it by little and little , for her eyes is gettin ’ old ,</l>

      <head>UNCLE SAMMY .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Some men were born for great things ,</l>
       <l n="2">Some were born for small ;</l>
       <l n="3">Some — it is not recorded</l>
       <l n="4">Why they were born at all ;</l>
       <l n="5">But Uncle Sammy was certain he had a legitimate call .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Some were born with a talent ,</l>
       <l n="7">Some with scrip and land ;</l>
       <l n="8">Some with a spoon of silver ,</l>
       <l n="9">And some with a different brand ;</l>
       <l n="10">But Uncle Sammy came holding an argument in each hand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Arguments sprouted within him ,</l>
       <l n="12">And twinked in his little eye ;</l>
       <l n="13">He lay and calmly debated</l>
       <l n="14">When average babies cry ,</l>
       <l n="15">And seemed to be pondering gravely whether to live or to die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">But prejudiced on that question</l>
       <l n="17">He grew from day to day ,</l>
       <l n="18">And finally he concluded</l>
       <l n="19">‘ Twas better for him to stay ;</l>
       <l n="20">And so into life 's discussion he reasoned and reasoned his way .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">Through childhood , through youth , into manhood</l>
       <l n="22">Argued and argued he ;</l>
       <l n="23">And he married a simple maiden ,</l>
       <l n="24">Though scarcely in love was she ;</l>
       <l n="25">But he reasoned the matter so clearly she hardly could help but agree .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">And though at first she was blooming ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the new firm started strong ,</l>
       <l n="28">And though Uncle Sammy loved her ,</l>
       <l n="29">And tried to help her along ,</l>
       <l n="30">She faded away in silence , and ‘ twas evident something was wrong .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">Now Uncle Sammy was faithful ,</l>
       <l n="32">And various remedies tried ;</l>
       <l n="33">He gave her the doctor 's prescriptions ,</l>
       <l n="34">And plenty of logic beside ;</l>
       <l n="35">But logic and medicine failed him , and so one day she died .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">He laid her away in the church-yard ,</l>
       <l n="37">So haggard and crushed and wan ;</l>
       <l n="38">And reared her a costly tombstone</l>
       <l n="39">With all of her virtues on ;</l>
       <l n="40">And ought to have added , “ A victim to arguments pro and con . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="41">For many a year Uncle Sammy</l>
       <l n="42">Fired away at his logical forte :</l>
       <l n="43">Discussion was his occupation ,</l>
       <l n="44">And altercation his sport ;</l>
       <l n="45">He argued himself out of churches , he argued himself into court .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="46">But alas for his peace and quiet ,</l>
       <l n="47">One day , when he went it blind ,</l>
       <l n="48">And followed his singular fancy ,</l>
       <l n="49">And slighted his logical mind ,</l>
       <l n="50">And married a ponderous widow that was n't of the arguing kind !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="51">Her sentiments all were settled ,</l>
       <l n="52">Her habits were planted and grown ,</l>
       <l n="53">Her heart was a starved little creature</l>
       <l n="54">That followed a will of her own ;</l>
       <l n="55">And she raised a high hand with Sammy , and proceeded to play it alone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="56">Then Sammy he charged down upon her</l>
       <l n="57">With all of his strength and his wit ,</l>
       <l n="58">And many a dextrous encounter ,</l>
       <l n="59">And many a fair shoulder-hit ;</l>
       <l n="60">But vain were his blows and his blowing : he never could budge her a bit .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="61">He laid down his premises round her ,</l>
       <l n="62">He scraped at her with his saws ;</l>
       <l n="63">He rained great facts upon her ,</l>
       <l n="64">And read her the marriage laws ;</l>
       <l n="65">But the harder he tried to convince her , the harder and harder she was .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="66">She brought home all her preachers ,</l>
       <l n="67">As many as ever she could —</l>
       <l n="68">With sentiments terribly settled ,</l>
       <l n="69">And appetites horribly good —</l>
       <l n="70">Who sat with him long at his table , and explained to him where he stood .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="72">And Sammy was not long in learning</l>
       <l n="73">To follow the swing of her gown ,</l>
       <l n="74">And came to be faithful in watching</l>
       <l n="75">The phase of her smile and her frown ;</l>
       <l n="76">And she , with the heel of assertion , soon tramped all his arguments down .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="77">And so , with his life-aspirations</l>

       <l n="80">Unceasingly pressing his neck —</l>
       <l n="81">He wrote on his face , “ I 'm a victim , ” and drifted — a logical wreck .</l>

       <l n="82">And farmers , whom he had argued</l>
       <l n="83">To corners tight and fast ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="93">The neighbors laid out their old neighbor ,</l>

       <l n="9">I doubted all o ’ the maxims , an ’ felt that it was n't fair .</l>
      </lg>

      <head>THE EDITOR 'S GUESTS .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The Editor sat in his sanctum , his countenance furrowed with care ,</l>
       <l n="2">His mind at the bottom of business , his feet at the top of a chair ,</l>
       <l n="3">His chair-arm an elbow supporting , his right hand upholding his head ,</l>
       <l n="4">His eyes on his dusty old table , with different documents spread :</l>
       <l n="5">There were thirty long pages from Howler , with underlined capitals</l>
       <l n="6">topped ,</l>
       <l n="7">And a short disquisition from Growler , requesting his newspaper stopped ;</l>
       <l n="8">There were lyrics from Gusher , the poet , concerning sweet flow'rets and</l>
       <l n="9">zephyrs ,</l>
       <l n="10">And a stray gem from Plodder , the farmer , describing a couple of heifers ;</l>
       <l n="11">There were billets from beautiful maidens , and bills from a grocer or two ,</l>
       <l n="12">And his best leader hitched to a letter , which inquired if he wrote it ,</l>
       <l n="13">or who ?</l>
       <l n="14">There were raptures of praises from writers of the weakly mellifluous</l>
       <l n="15">school ,</l>
       <l n="16">And one of his rival 's last papers , informing him he was a fool ;</l>
       <l n="17">There were several long resolutions , with names telling whom they were by ,</l>
       <l n="18">Canonizing some harmless old brother who had done nothing worse than to</l>
       <l n="19">die ;</l>
       <l n="20">There were traps on that table to catch him , and serpents to sting and to</l>
       <l n="21">smite him ;</l>
       <l n="22">There were gift enterprises to sell him , and bitters attempting to bite</l>
       <l n="23">him ;</l>
       <l n="24">There were long staring “ ads ” from the city , and money with never a one ,</l>
       <l n="25">Which added , “ Please give this insertion , and send in your bill when</l>
       <l n="26">you 're done ; ”</l>
       <l n="27">There were letters from organizations — their meetings , their wants , and</l>
       <l n="28">their laws —</l>
       <l n="29">Which said , “ Can you print this announcement for the good of our glorious</l>
       <l n="30">cause ? ”</l>
       <l n="31">There were tickets inviting his presence to festivals , parties , and shows ,</l>
       <l n="32">Wrapped in notes with “ Please give us a notice ” demurely slipped in at the</l>
       <l n="33">close ;</l>
       <l n="34">In short , as his eye took the table , and ran o'er its ink-spattered trash ,</l>
       <l n="35">There was nothing it did not encounter , excepting perhaps it was cash .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="36">The Editor dreamily pondered on several ponderous things .</l>
       <l n="37">On different lines of action , and the pulling of different strings ;</l>
       <l n="38">Upon some equivocal doings , and some unequivocal duns ;</l>
       <l n="39">On how few of his numerous patrons were quietly prompt-paying ones ;</l>
       <l n="40">On friends who subscribed “ just to help him , ” and wordy encouragement</l>
       <l n="41">lent ,</l>
       <l n="42">And had given him plenty of counsel , but never had paid him a cent ;</l>
       <l n="43">On vinegar , kind-hearted people were feeding him every hour ,</l>
       <l n="44">Who saw not the work they were doing , but wondered that “ printers are</l>
       <l n="45">sour : ”</l>
       <l n="46">On several intelligent townsmen , whose kindness was so without stint</l>
       <l n="47">That they kept an eye out on his business , and told him just what he</l>
       <l n="48">should print ;</l>
       <l n="49">On men who had rendered him favors , and never pushed forward their claims ,</l>
       <l n="50">So long as the paper was crowded with “ locals ” containing their names ;</l>
       <l n="51">On various other small matters , sufficient his temper to roil ,</l>
       <l n="52">And finely contrived to be making the blood of an editor boil ;</l>
       <l n="53">And so one may see that his feelings could hardly be said to be smooth ,</l>
       <l n="54">And he needed some pleasant occurrence his ruffled emotions to soothe :</l>
       <l n="55">He had it ; for lo ! on the threshold , a slow and reliable tread ,</l>
       <l n="56">And a farmer invaded the sanctum , and these are the words that he said :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="57">“ Good-mornin ’ , sir , Mr . Printer ; how is your body to-day ?</l>
       <l n="58">I 'm glad you 're to home ; for you fellers is al'ays a runnin ’ away .</l>
       <l n="59">Your paper last week wa'n ' t so spicy nor sharp as the one week before :</l>
       <l n="60">But I s'pose when the campaign is opened , you 'll be whoopin ’ it up to</l>
       <l n="61">‘ em more .</l>
       <l n="62">That feller that 's printin ’ The Smasher is goin ’ for you perty smart ;</l>
       <l n="63">And our folks said this mornin ’ at breakfast , they thought he was gettin ’</l>
       <l n="64">the start .</l>
       <l n="65">But I hushed ‘ em right up in a minute , and said a good word for you ;</l>
       <l n="66">I told ‘ em I b'lieved you was tryin ’ to do just as well as you knew ;</l>
       <l n="67">And I told ‘ em that some one was sayin ’ , and whoever ‘ twas it is so ,</l>
       <l n="68">That you can n't expect much of no one man , nor blame him for what he do n't</l>
       <l n="69">know .</l>
       <l n="70">But , layin ’ aside pleasure for business , I 've brought you my little boy</l>
       <l n="71">Jim ;</l>
       <l n="72">And I thought I would see if you could n't make an editor outen of him .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="73">“ My family stock is increasin ’ , while other folks ’ seems to run short .</l>
       <l n="74">I 've got a right smart of a family — it 's one of the old-fashioned sort :</l>
       <l n="75">There 's Ichabod , Isaac , and Israel , a-workin ’ away on the farm —</l>
       <l n="76">They do ‘ bout as much as one good boy , and make things go off like a</l>
       <l n="77">charm .</l>
       <l n="78">There 's Moses and Aaron are sly ones , and slip like a couple of eels ;</l>
       <l n="79">But they 're tol'able steady in one thing — they al'ays git round to their</l>
       <l n="80">meals .</l>
       <l n="81">There 's Peter is busy inventin ’ ( though what he invents I can n't see ) ,</l>
       <l n="82">And Joseph is studyin ’ medicine — and both of ‘ em boardin ’ with me .</l>
       <l n="83">There 's Abram and Albert is married , each workin ’ my farm for myself ,</l>
       <l n="84">And Sam smashed his nose at a shootin ’ , and so he is laid on the shelf .</l>
       <l n="85">The rest of the boys are all growin ’ , ‘ cept this little runt , which is</l>
       <l n="86">Jim ,</l>
       <l n="87">And I thought that perhaps I 'd be makin ’ an editor outen o ’ him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="88">“ He ai n't no great shakes for to labor , though I 've labored with him a</l>
       <l n="89">good deal ,</l>
       <l n="90">And give him some strappin ’ good arguments I know he could n't help but</l>
       <l n="91">to feel ;</l>
       <l n="92">But he 's built out of second-growth timber , and nothin ’ about him is big</l>
       <l n="93">Exceptin ’ his appetite only , and there he 's as good as a pig .</l>
       <l n="94">I keep him a-carryin ’ luncheons , and fillin ’ and bringin ’ the jugs ,</l>
       <l n="95">And take him among the pertatoes , and set him to pickin ’ the bugs ;</l>
       <l n="96">And then there is things to be doin ’ a-helpin ’ the women indoors ;</l>
       <l n="97">There 's churnin ’ and washin ’ of dishes , and other descriptions of chores ;</l>
       <l n="98">But he do n't take to nothin ’ but victuals , and he 'll never be much ,</l>
       <l n="99">I 'm afraid ,</l>
       <l n="100">So I thought it would be a good notion to larn him the editor 's trade .</l>
       <l n="101">His body 's too small for a farmer , his judgment is rather too slim ,</l>
       <l n="102">But I thought we perhaps could be makin ’ an editor outen o ’ him !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="103">“ It ai n't much to get up a paper — it would n't take him long for to learn ;</l>

       <l n="105">turn .</l>
       <l n="106">And things that was once hard in doin ’ , is easy enough now to do ;</l>
       <l n="107">Just keep your eye on your machinery , and crack your arrangements right</l>
       <l n="108">through .</l>
       <l n="109">I used for to wonder at readin ’ and where it was got up , and how ;</l>
       <l n="110">But ‘ tis most of it made by machinery — I can see it all plain enough now .</l>
       <l n="111">And poetry , too , is constructed by machines of different designs ,</l>
       <l n="112">Each one with a gauge and a chopper to see to the length of the lines ;</l>
       <l n="113">And I hear a New York clairvoyant is runnin ’ one sleeker than grease ,</l>
       <l n="114">And a-rentin ’ her heaven-born productions at a couple of dollars apiece ;</l>
       <l n="115">An ’ since the whole trade has growed easy , ‘ twould be easy enough , I 've</l>

       <l n="118">The Editor sat in his sanctum and looked the old man in the eye ,</l>
       <l n="119">Then glanced at the grinning young hopeful , and mournfully made his reply :</l>
       <l n="120">“ Is your son a small unbound edition of Moses and Solomon both ?</l>
       <l n="121">Can he compass his spirit with meekness , and strangle a natural oath ?</l>

       <l n="123">cheek ?</l>
       <l n="124">Can he do an hour 's work in a minute , and live on a sixpence a week ?</l>
       <l n="125">Can he courteously talk to an equal , and browbeat an impudent dunce ?</l>
       <l n="126">Can he keep things in apple-pie order , and do half a dozen at once ?</l>
       <l n="127">Can he press all the springs of knowledge , with quick and reliable touch ,</l>
       <l n="128">And be sure that he knows how much to know , and knows how to not</l>
       <l n="129">know too much ?</l>
       <l n="130">Does he know how to spur up his virtue , and put a check-rein on his pride ?</l>
       <l n="131">Can he carry a gentleman 's manners within a rhinoceros ’ hide ?</l>
       <l n="132">Can he know all , and do all , and be all , with cheerfulness , courage ,</l>

      <head>OUR ARMY OF THE DEAD .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">By the edge of the Atlantic , where the waves of Freedom roar ,</l>
       <l n="2">And the breezes of the ocean chant a requiem to the shore ,</l>
       <l n="3">On the Nation 's eastern hill-tops , where its corner-stone was laid ,</l>
       <l n="4">On the mountains of New England , where our fathers toiled and prayed ,</l>
       <l n="5">Mid old Key-stone 's rugged riches , which the miner 's hand await ,</l>
       <l n="6">Mid the never-ceasing commerce of the busy Empire State ,</l>
       <l n="7">With the country 's love and honor on each brave , devoted head ,</l>
       <l n="8">Is a band of noble heroes — is our Army of the Dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">On the lake-encircled homestead of the thriving Wolverine ,</l>
       <l n="10">On the beauteous Western prairies , with their carpeting of green ,</l>
       <l n="11">By the sweeping Mississippi , long our country 's pride and boast ,</l>
       <l n="12">On the rugged Rocky Mountains , and the weird Pacific coast ,</l>
       <l n="13">In the listless , sunny Southland , with its blossoms and its vines ,</l>
       <l n="14">On the bracing Northern hill-tops , and amid their murmuring pines ,</l>
       <l n="15">Over all our happy country — over all our Nation spread ,</l>
       <l n="16">Is a band of noble heroes — is our Army of the Dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">Not with musket , and with saber , and with glad heart beating fast ;</l>
       <l n="18">Not with cannon that had thundered till the bloody war was past ;</l>
       <l n="19">Not with voices that are shouting with the vim of victory 's note ;</l>
       <l n="20">Not with armor gayly glistening , and with flags that proudly float ;</l>
       <l n="21">Not with air of martial vigor , nor with steady , soldier tramp ,</l>
       <l n="22">Come they grandly marching to us — for the boys are all in camp .</l>
       <l n="23">With forgetfulness upon it — each within his earthy bed ,</l>
       <l n="24">Waiting for his marching orders — is our Army of the Dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Fast asleep the boys are lying , in their low and narrow tents ,</l>
       <l n="26">And no battle-cry can wake them , and no orders call them hence ;</l>
       <l n="27">And the yearnings of the mother , and the anguish of the wife ,</l>
       <l n="28">Can not with their magic presence call the soldier back to life ;</l>
       <l n="29">And the brother 's manly sorrow , and the father 's mournful pride ,</l>
       <l n="30">Can not give back to his country him who for his country died .</l>
       <l n="31">They who for the trembling Nation in its hour of trial bled ,</l>
       <l n="32">Lie , in these its years of triumph , with our Army of the Dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">When the years of Earth are over , and the cares of Earth are done ,</l>
       <l n="34">When the reign of Time is ended , and Eternity begun ,</l>
       <l n="35">When the thunders of Omniscience on our wakened senses roll ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the sky above shall wither , and be gathered like a scroll ;</l>
       <l n="37">When , among the lofty mountains , and across the mighty sea ,</l>
       <l n="38">The sublime celestial bugler shall ring out the reveille ,</l>
       <l n="39">Then shall march with brightest laurels , and with proud , victorious tread ,</l>
       <l n="40">To their station up in heaven , our Grand Army of the Dead !</l>

     <head>ONE AND TWO .</head>
     <p>I . If you to me be cold , Or I be false to you , The world will go on , I think , Just as it used to do ; The clouds will flirt with the moon , The sun will kiss the sea , The wind to the trees will whisper , And laugh at you and me ; But the sun will not shine so bright , The clouds will not seem so white , To one , as they will to two ; So I think you had better be kind , And I had best be true , And let the old love go on , Just as it used to do .</p>
     <p>II . If the whole of a page be read , If a book be finished through , Still the world may read on , I think , Just as it used to do ; For other lovers will con The pages that we have passed , And the treacherous gold of the binding Will glitter unto the last . But lids have a lonely look , And one may not read the book — It opens only to two ; So I think you had better be kind , And I had best be true , And let the reading go on , Just as it used to do .</p>
     <p>III . If we who have sailed together Flit out of each other 's view , The world will sail on , I think , Just as it used to do ; And we may reckon by stars That flash from different skies , And another of love 's pirates May capture my lost prize ; But ships long time together Can better the tempest weather Than any other two ; So I think you had better be kind , And I had best be true , That we together may sail , Just as we used to do .</p>

       <l n="54">The lost is found , the dead alive , my safety is achieved !</l>
       <l n="55">For he waves his hand again , and shouts , “ The prisoner is reprieved ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">Now , mother , praise the God you love , and raise your drooping head ;</l>
       <l n="57">For the murderous gallows , black and grim , is cheated of its dead !</l>

      <head>UP THE LINE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Through blinding storm and clouds of night ,</l>
       <l n="2">We swiftly pushed our restless flight ;</l>
       <l n="3">With thundering hoof and warning neigh ,</l>
       <l n="4">We urged our steed upon his way</l>
       <l n="5">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Afar the lofty head-light gleamed ;</l>
       <l n="7">Afar the whistle shrieked and screamed ;</l>
       <l n="8">And glistening bright , and rising high ,</l>
       <l n="9">Our flakes of fire bestrewed the sky ,</l>
       <l n="10">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Adown the long , complaining track ,</l>
       <l n="12">Our wheels a message hurried back ;</l>
       <l n="13">And quivering through the rails ahead ,</l>
       <l n="14">Went news of our resistless tread ,</l>
       <l n="15">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">The trees gave back our din and shout ,</l>
       <l n="17">And flung their shadow arms about ;</l>
       <l n="18">And shivering in their coats of gray ,</l>
       <l n="19">They heard us roaring far away ,</l>
       <l n="20">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">The wailing storm came on apace ,</l>
       <l n="22">And dashed its tears into our fade ;</l>
       <l n="23">But steadily still we pierced it through ,</l>
       <l n="24">And cut the sweeping wind in two ,</l>
       <l n="25">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">A rattling rush across the ridge ,</l>
       <l n="27">A thunder-peal beneath the bridge ;</l>
       <l n="28">And valley and hill and sober plain</l>
       <l n="29">Re-echoed our triumphant strain ,</l>
       <l n="30">Up the line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">And when the Eastern streaks of gray</l>
       <l n="32">Bespoke the dawn of coming day ,</l>
       <l n="33">We halted our steed , his journey o'er ,</l>
       <l n="34">And urged his giant form no more ,</l>
       <l n="35">Up the line .</l>

     <head>HOW WE KEPT THE DAY .</head>
     <p>I . The great procession came up the street , With clatter of hoofs and tramp of feet ; There was General Jones to guide the van , And Corporal Jinks , his right-hand man ; And each was riding his high horse , And each had epaulettes , of course ; And each had a sash of the bloodiest red , And each had a shako on his head ; And each had a sword by his left side , And each had his mustache newly dyed ; And that was the way We kept the day , The great , the grand , the glorious day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With a battle or two , the histories say ,) Our National Independence !</p>
     <p>II . The great procession came up the street , With loud da capo , and brazen repeat ; There was Hans , the leader , a Teuton born , A sharp who worried the E flat horn ; And Baritone Jake , and Alto Mike , Who never played any thing twice alike ; And Tenor Tom , of conservative mind , Who always came out a note behind ; And Dick , whose tuba was seldom dumb , And Bob , who punished the big bass drum . And when they stopped a minute to rest , The martial band discoursed its best ; The ponderous drum and the pointed fife Proceeded to roll and shriek for life ; And Bonaparte Crossed the Rhine , anon , And The Girl I Left Behind Me came on ; And that was the way The bands did play On the loud , high-toned , harmonious day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With some music of bullets , our sires would say ,) Our glorious Independence !</p>
     <p>III . The great procession came up the street , With a wagon of virgins , sour and sweet ; Each bearing the bloom of recent date , Each misrepresenting a single State . There was California , pious and prim , And Louisiana , humming a hymn ; The Texas lass was the smallest one — Rhode Island weighed the tenth of a ton ; The Empire State was pure as a pearl , And Massachusetts a modest girl ; Vermont was red as the blush of a rose — And the goddess sported a turn-up nose ; And looked , free sylph , where she painfully sat , The worlds she would give to be out of that . And in this way The maidens gay Flashed up the street on the beautiful day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With some sacrifices , our mothers would say ,) Our glorious Independence !</p>
     <p>IV . The great procession came up the street , With firemen uniformed flashily neat ; There was Tubbs , the foreman , with voice like five , The happiest , proudest man alive ; With a trumpet half as long as a gun , Which he used for the glory of “ Number 1 ; ” There was Nubbs , who had climbed a ladder high , And saved a dog that was left to die ; There was Cubbs , who had dressed in black and blue The eye of the foreman of Number 2 . And each marched on with steady stride , And each had a look of fiery pride ; And each glanced slyly round , with a whim That all of the girls were looking at him ; And that was the way , With grand display , They marched through the blaze of the glowing day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With some hot fighting , our fathers would say ,) Our glorious Independence !</p>
     <p>V. The eager orator took the stand , In the cause of our great and happy land ; He aired his own political views , He told us all of the latest news : How the Boston folks one night took tea — Their grounds for steeping it in the sea ; What a heap of Britons our fathers did kill , At the little skirmish of Bunker Hill ; He put us all in anxious doubt As to how that matter was coming out ; And when at last he had fought us through To the bloodless year of ‘ 82 , ‘ Twas the fervent hope of every one That he , as well as the war , was done . But he continued to painfully soar For something less than a century more ; Until at last he had fairly begun The wars of eighteen-sixty-one ; And never rested till ‘ neath the tree That shadowed the glory of Robert Lee . And then he inquired , with martial frown , “ Americans , must we go down ? ” And as an answer from Heaven were sent , The stand gave way , and down he went . A singer or two beneath him did drop — A big fat alderman fell atop ; And that was the way Our orator lay , Till we fished him out , on the eloquent day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With a clash of arms , Pat . Henry would say ,) Our wordy Independence !</p>
     <p>VI . The marshal his hungry compatriots led , Where Freedom 's viands were thickly spread , With all that man or woman could eat , From crisp to sticky — from sour to sweet . There were chickens that scarce had learned to crow , And veteran roosters of long ago ; There was one old turkey , huge and fierce , That was hatched in the days of President Pierce ; Of which , at last , with an ominous groan , The parson essayed to swallow a bone ; And it took three sinners , plucky and stout , To grapple the evil and bring it out . And still the dinner went merrily on , And James and Lucy and Hannah and John Kept winking their eyes and smacking their lips , And passing the eatables into eclipse . And that was the way The grand array Of victuals vanished on that day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With some starvation , the records say ,) Our well-fed Independence !</p>
     <p>VII . The people went home through the sultry night , In a murky mood and a pitiful plight ; Not more had the rockets ’ sticks gone down , Than the spirits of them who had “ been to town ; ” Not more did the fire-balloon collapse , Than the pride of them who had known mishaps . There were feathers ruffled , and tempers roiled , And several brand-new dresses spoiled ; There were hearts that ached from envy 's thorns , And feet that twinged with trampled corns ; There were joys proved empty , through and through , And several purses empty , too ; And some reeled homeward , muddled and late , Who had n't taken their glory straight ; And some were fated to lodge , that night , In the city lock-up , snug and tight ; And that was the way The deuce was to pay , As it always is , at the close of the day , That gave us — Hurray ! Hurray ! Hurray ! ( With some restrictions , the fault-finders say ,) That which , please God , we will keep for aye — Our National Independence !</p>
