   <head>A LAMENT</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ The parted spirit ,</l>
     <l n="3">Knoweth it not our sorrow ? Answereth not</l>
     <l n="4">Its blessing to our tears ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">The circle is broken , one seat is forsaken ,</l>
     <l n="6">One bud from the tree of our friendship is shaken ;</l>
     <l n="7">One heart from among us no longer shall thrill</l>
     <l n="8">With joy in our gladness , or grief in our ill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">Weep ! lonely and lowly are slumbering now</l>
     <l n="10">The light of her glances , the pride of her brow ;</l>
     <l n="11">Weep ! sadly and long shall we listen in vain</l>
     <l n="12">To hear the soft tones of her welcome again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">Give our tears to the dead ! For humanity 's claim</l>
     <l n="14">From its silence and darkness is ever the same ;</l>
     <l n="15">The hope of that world whose existence is bliss</l>
     <l n="16">May not stifle the tears of the mourners of this .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="17">For , oh ! if one glance the freed spirit can throw</l>
     <l n="18">On the scene of its troubled probation below ,</l>
     <l n="19">Than the pride of the marble , the pomp of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="20">To that glance will be dearer the tears which we shed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="21">Oh , who can forget the mild light of her smile ,</l>
     <l n="22">Over lips moved with music and feeling the while ,</l>
     <l n="23">The eye 's deep enchantment , dark , dream-like , and clear ,</l>
     <l n="24">In the glow of its gladness , the shade of its tear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="25">And the charm of her features , while over the whole</l>
     <l n="26">Played the hues of the heart and the sunshine of soul ;</l>
     <l n="27">And the tones of her voice , like the music which seems</l>
     <l n="28">Murmured low in our ears by the Angel of dreams !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="29">But holier and dearer our memories hold</l>
     <l n="30">Those treasures of feeling , more precious than gold ,</l>
     <l n="31">The love and the kindness and pity which gave</l>
     <l n="32">Fresh flowers for the bridal , green wreaths for the grave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="33">The heart ever open to Charity 's claim ,</l>
     <l n="34">Unmoved from its purpose by censure and blame ,</l>
     <l n="35">While vainly alike on her eye and her ear</l>
     <l n="36">Fell the scorn of the heartless , the jesting and jeer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="37">How true to our hearts was that beautiful sleeper</l>
     <l n="38">With smiles for the joyful , with tears for the weeper ,</l>
     <l n="39">Yet , evermore prompt , whether mournful or gay ,</l>
     <l n="40">With warnings in love to the passing astray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="41">For , though spotless herself , she could sorrow for them</l>
     <l n="42">Who sullied with evil the spirit 's pure gem ;</l>
     <l n="43">And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the sting of reproof was still tempered by love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="45">As a cloud of the sunset , slow melting in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="46">As a star that is lost when the daylight is given ,</l>
     <l n="47">As a glad dream of slumber , which wakens in bliss ,</l>
     <l n="48">She hath passed to the world of the holy from this .</l>

    <head>TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES B. STORRS ,</head>
    <head>Late President of Western Reserve College , who died at his post of duty , overworn by his strenuous labors with tongue and pen in the cause of Human Freedom .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thou hast fallen in thine armor ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thou martyr of the Lord</l>
     <l n="3">With thy last breath crying “ Onward ! ”</l>
     <l n="4">And thy hand upon the sword .</l>
     <l n="5">The haughty heart derideth ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the sinful lip reviles ,</l>
     <l n="7">But the blessing of the perishing</l>
     <l n="8">Around thy pillow smiles !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">When to our cup of trembling</l>
     <l n="10">The added drop is given ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the long-suspended thunder</l>
     <l n="12">Falls terribly from Heaven ,—</l>
     <l n="13">When a new and fearful freedom</l>
     <l n="14">Is proffered of the Lord</l>
     <l n="15">To the slow-consuming Famine ,</l>
     <l n="16">The Pestilence and Sword !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">When the refuges of Falsehood</l>
     <l n="18">Shall be swept away in wrath ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the temple shall be shaken ,</l>
     <l n="20">With its idol , to the earth ,</l>
     <l n="21">Shall not thy words of warning</l>
     <l n="22">Be all remembered then ?</l>
     <l n="23">And thy now unheeded message</l>
     <l n="24">Burn in the hearts of men ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Oppression 's hand may scatter</l>
     <l n="26">Its nettles on thy tomb ,</l>
     <l n="27">And even Christian bosoms</l>
     <l n="28">Deny thy memory room ;</l>
     <l n="29">For lying lips shall torture</l>
     <l n="30">Thy mercy into crime ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the slanderer shall flourish</l>
     <l n="32">As the bay-tree for a time .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But where the south-wind lingers</l>
     <l n="34">On Carolina 's pines ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or falls the careless sunbeam</l>
     <l n="36">Down Georgia 's golden mines ;</l>
     <l n="37">Where now beneath his burthen</l>
     <l n="38">The toiling slave is driven ;</l>
     <l n="39">Where now a tyrant 's mockery</l>
     <l n="40">Is offered unto Heaven ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Where Mammon hath its altars</l>
     <l n="42">Wet o'er with human blood ,</l>
     <l n="43">And pride and lust debases</l>
     <l n="44">The workmanship of God ,—</l>
     <l n="45">There shall thy praise be spoken ,</l>
     <l n="46">Redeemed from Falsehood 's ban ,</l>
     <l n="47">When the fetters shall be broken ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the slave shall be a man !</l>

     <l n="49">Joy to thy spirit , brother !</l>
     <l n="50">A thousand hearts are warm ,</l>

     <l n="68">Imperishable still .</l>
     <l n="69">The words which thou hast uttered</l>

    <head>FOLLEN . ON READING HIS ESSAY ON THE “ FUTURE STATE . ”</head>
    <head>Charles Follen , one of the noblest contributions of Germany to American citizenship , was at an early age driven from his professorship in the University of Jena , and compelled to seek shelter from official prosecution in Switzerland , on account of his liberal political opinions . He became Professor of Civil Law in the University of Basle . The governments of Prussia , Austria , and Russia united in demanding his delivery as a political offender ; and , in consequence , he left Switzerland , and came to the United States . At the time of the formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society he was a Professor in Harvard University , honored for his genius , learning , and estimable character . His love of liberty and hatred of oppression led him to seek an interview with Garrison and express his sympathy with him . Soon after , he attended a meeting of the New England Anti-Slavery Society . An able speech was made by Rev . A . A. Phelps , and a letter of mine addressed to the Secretary of the Society was read . Whereupon he rose and stated that his views were in unison with those of the Society , and that after hearing the speech and the letter , he was ready to join it , and abide the probable consequences of such an unpopular act . He lost by so doing his professorship . He was an able member of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society . He perished in the ill-fated steamer Lexington , which was burned on its passage from New York , January 13 , 1840 . The few writings left behind him show him to have been a profound thinker of rare spiritual insight .</head>

    <head>CHALKLEY HALL .</head>
    <head>Chalkley Hall , near Frankford , Pa ., was the residence of Thomas Chalkley , an eminent minister of the Friends ’ denomination . He was one of the early settlers of the Colony , and his Journal , which was published in 1749 , presents a quaint but beautiful picture of a life of unostentatious and simple goodness . He was the master of a merchant vessel , and , in his visits to the west Indies and Great Britain , omitted no opportunity to labor for the highest interests of his fellow-men . During a temporary residence in Philadelphia , in the summer of 1838 , the quiet and beautiful scenery around the ancient village of Frankford frequently attracted me from the heat and bustle of the city . I have referred to my youthful acquaintance with his writings in Snow-Bound .</head>

    <head>TO RONGE .</head>
    <head>This was written after reading the powerful and manly protest of Johannes Ronge against the “ pious fraud ” of the Bishop of Treves . The bold movement of the young Catholic priest of Prussian Silesia seemed to me full of promise to the cause of political as well as religious liberty in Europe . That it failed was due partly to the faults of the reformer , but mainly to the disagreement of the Liberals of Germany upon a matter of dogma , which prevented them from unity of action . Rouge was born in Silesia in 1813 and died in October , 1887 . His autobiography was translated into English and published in London in 1846 .</head>

    <head>CHANNING .</head>
    <head>The last time I saw Dr. Channing was in the summer of 1841 , when , in company with my English friend , Joseph Sturge , so well known for his philanthropic labors and liberal political opinions , I visited him in his summer residence in Rhode Island . In recalling the impressions of that visit , it can scarcely be necessary to say , that I have no reference to the peculiar religious opinions of a man whose life , beautifully and truly manifested above the atmosphere of sect , is now the world 's common legacy .</head>

    <head>ELLIOTT .</head>
    <head>Ebenezer Elliott was to the artisans of England what Burns was to the peasantry of Scotland . His Corn-law Rhymes contributed not a little to that overwhelming tide of popular opinion and feeling which resulted in the repeal of the tax on bread . Well has the eloquent author of The Reforms and Reformers of Great Britain said of him , “ Not corn-law repealers alone , but all Britons who moisten their scanty bread with the sweat of the brow , are largely indebted to his inspiring lay , for the mighty bound which the laboring mind of England has taken in our day . ”</head>

    <head>ICHABOD</head>
    <head>This poem was the outcome of the surprise and grief and forecast of evil consequences which I felt on reading the seventh of March speech of Daniel Webster in support of the “ compromise , ” and the Fugitive Slave Law . No partisan or personal enmity dictated it . On the contrary my admiration of the splendid personality and intellectual power of the great Senator was never stronger than when I laid down his speech , and , in one of the saddest moments of my life , penned my protest . I saw , as I wrote , with painful clearness its sure results ,— the Slave Power arrogant and defiant , strengthened and encouraged to carry out its scheme for the extension of its baleful system , or the dissolution of the Union , the guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken down , and the whole country made the hunting-ground of slave-catchers . In the horror of such a vision , so soon fearfully fulfilled , if one spoke at all , he could only speak in tones of stern and sorrowful rebuke . But death softens all resentments , and the consciousness of a common inheritance of frailty and weakness modifies the severity of judgment . Years after , in The Lost Occasion I gave utterance to an almost universal regret that the great statesman did not live to see the flag which he loved trampled under the feet of Slavery , and , in view of this desecration , make his last days glorious in defence of “ Liberty and Union , one and inseparable . ”</head>

     <l n="13">To smite the Python of our land and time ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fell as the monster born of Crissa 's slime ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like the blind bard who in Castalian springs</l>

     <l n="24">When , years ago , beside the summer sea ,</l>
     <l n="25">White in the moon , we saw the long waves fall</l>
     <l n="26">Baffled and broken from the rocky wall ,</l>
     <l n="27">That , to the menace of the brawling flood ,</l>
     <l n="28">Opposed alone its massive quietude ,</l>
     <l n="29">Calm as a fate ; with not a leaf nor vine</l>
     <l n="30">Nor birch-spray trembling in the still moonshine ,</l>
     <l n="31">Crowning it like God 's peace . I sometimes think</l>
     <l n="32">That night-scene by the sea prophetical ,</l>
     <l n="33">( For Nature speaks in symbols and in signs ,</l>
     <l n="34">And through her pictures human fate divines ) ,</l>
     <l n="35">That rock , wherefrom we saw the billows sink</l>
     <l n="36">In murmuring rout , uprising clear and tall</l>
     <l n="37">In the white light of heaven , the type of one</l>
     <l n="38">Who , momently by Error 's host assailed ,</l>

   <p>THEIRS</p>
   <p>I . Fate summoned , in gray-bearded age , to act A history stranger than his written fact , Him who portrayed the splendor and the gloom Of that great hour when throne and altar fell With long death-groan which still is audible . He , when around the walls of Paris rung The Prussian bugle like the blast of doom , And every ill which follows unblest war Maddened all France from Finistere to Var , The weight of fourscore from his shoulders flung , And guided Freedom in the path he saw Lead out of chaos into light and law , Peace , not imperial , but republican , And order pledged to all the Rights of Man .</p>
   <p>II . Death called him from a need as imminent As that from which the Silent William went When powers of evil , like the smiting seas On Holland 's dikes , assailed her liberties . Sadly , while yet in doubtful balance hung The weal and woe of France , the bells were rung For her lost leader . Paralyzed of will , Above his bier the hearts of men stood still . Then , as if set to his dead lips , the horn Of Roland wound once more to rouse and warn , The old voice filled the air ! His last brave word Not vainly France to all her boundaries stirred . Strong as in life , he still for Freedom wrought , As the dead Cid at red Toloso fought .</p>

   <p>BAYARD TAYLOR .</p>
   <p>I . “ And where now , Bayard , will thy footsteps tend ? ” My sister asked our guest one winter 's day . Smiling he answered in the Friends ’ sweet way Common to both : “ Wherever thou shall send ! What wouldst thou have me see for thee ? ” She laughed , Her dark eyes dancing in the wood-fire 's glow “ Loffoden isles , the Kilpis , and the low , Unsetting sun on Finmark 's fishing-craft . ” “ All these and more I soon shall see for thee ! ” He answered cheerily : and he kept his pledge On Lapland snows , the North Cape 's windy wedge , And Tromso freezing in its winter sea . He went and came . But no man knows the track Of his last journey , and he comes not back !</p>
   <p>II . He brought us wonders of the new and old ; We shared all climes with him . The Arab 's tent To him its story-telling secret lent . And , pleased , we listened to the tales he told . His task , beguiled with songs that shall endure , In manly , honest thoroughness he wrought ; From humble home-lays to the heights of thought Slowly he climbed , but every step was sure . How , with the generous pride that friendship hath , We , who so loved him , saw at last the crown Of civic honor on his brows pressed down , Rejoiced , and knew not that the gift was death . And now for him , whose praise in deafened ears Two nations speak , we answer but with tears !</p>
   <p>III . O Vale of Chester ! trod by him so oft , Green as thy June turf keep his memory . Let Nor wood , nor dell , nor storied stream forget , Nor winds that blow round lonely Cedarcroft ; Let the home voices greet him in the far , Strange land that holds him ; let the messages Of love pursue him o'er the chartless seas And unmapped vastness of his unknown star Love 's language , heard beyond the loud discourse Of perishable fame , in every sphere Itself interprets ; and its utterance here Somewhere in God 's unfolding universe Shall reach our traveller , softening the surprise Of his rapt gaze on unfamiliar skies !</p>

    <head>Jean Pierre Brissot , the famous leader of the Girondist party in the French Revolution , when a young man travelled extensively in the United States . He visited the valley of the Merrimac , and speaks in terms of admiration of the view from Moulton 's hill opposite Amesbury . The “ Laurel Party ” so called , as composed of ladies and gentlemen in the lower valley of the Merrimac , and invited friends and guests in other sections of the country . Its thoroughly enjoyable annual festivals were held in the early summer on the pine-shaded , laurel-blossomed slopes of the Newbury side of the river opposite Pleasant Valley in Amesbury . The several poems called out by these gatherings are here printed in sequence .</head>

   <p>Written for the opening of the International Exhibition , Philadelphia , May 10 , 1876 . The music for the hymn was written by John K. Paine , and may be found in The Atlantic Monthly for June , 1876 .</p>
   <p>I . Our fathers ’ God ! from out whose hand The centuries fall like grains of sand , We meet to-day , united , free , And loyal to our land and Thee , To thank Thee for the era done , And trust Thee for the opening one .</p>
   <p>II . Here , where of old , by Thy design , The fathers spake that word of Thine Whose echo is the glad refrain Of rended bolt and falling chain , To grace our festal time , from all The zones of earth our guests we call .</p>
   <p>III . Be with us while the New World greets The Old World thronging all its streets , Unveiling all the triumphs won By art or toil beneath the sun ; And unto common good ordain This rivalship of hand and brain .</p>
   <p>IV . Thou , who hast here in concord furled The war flags of a gathered world , Beneath our Western skies fulfil The Orient 's mission of good-will , And , freighted with love 's Golden Fleece , Send back its Argonauts of peace .</p>
   <p>V. For art and labor met in truce , For beauty made the bride of use , We thank Thee ; but , withal , we crave The austere virtues strong to save , The honor proof to place or gold , The manhood never bought nor sold .</p>
   <p>VI . Oh make Thou us , through centuries long , In peace secure , in justice strong ; Around our gift of freedom draw The safeguards of Thy righteous law And , cast in some diviner mould , Let the new cycle shame the old !</p>

    <head>NORUMBEGA HALL .</head>
    <head>Norumbega Hall at Wellesley College , named in honor of Eben Norton Horsford , who has been one of the most munificent patrons of that noble institution , and who had just published an essay claiming the discovery of the site of the somewhat mythical city of Norumbega , was opened with appropriate ceremonies , in April , 1886 . The following sonnet was written for the occasion , and was read by President Alice E. Freeman , to whom it was addressed .</head>
     <l n="1">Not on Penobscot 's wooded bank the spires</l>
     <l n="2">Of the sought City rose , nor yet beside</l>

     <l n="5">The vision tarried ; but somewhere we knew</l>
     <l n="6">The beautiful gates must open to our quest ,</l>
     <l n="7">Somewhere that marvellous City of the West</l>
     <l n="8">Would lift its towers and palace domes in view ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , to ! at last its mystery is made known —</l>
     <l n="10">Its only dwellers maidens fair and young ,</l>
     <l n="11">Its Princess such as England 's Laureate sung ;</l>
     <l n="12">And safe from capture , save by love alone ,</l>
     <l n="13">It lends its beauty to the lake 's green shore ,</l>

    <head>THE TENT ON THE BEACH</head>
    <head>It can scarcely be necessary to name as the two companions whom I reckoned with myself in this poetical picnic , Fields the lettered magnate , and Taylor the free cosmopolite . The long line of sandy beach which defines almost the whole of the New Hampshire sea-coast is especially marked near its southern extremity , by the salt-meadows of Hampton . The Hampton River winds through these meadows , and the reader may , if he choose , imagine my tent pitched near its mouth , where also was the scene of the Wreck of Rivermouth . The green bluff to the northward is Great Boar 's Head ; southward is the Merrimac , with Newburyport lifting its steeples above brown roofs and green trees on banks .</head>

    <head>THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH</head>
    <head>The Goody Cole who figures in this poem and The Changeling as Eunice Cole , who for a quarter of a century or more was feared , persecuted , and hated as the witch of Hampton . She lived alone in a hovel a little distant from the spot where the Hampton Academy now stands , and there she died , unattended . When her death was discovered , she was hastily covered up in the earth near by , and a stake driven through her body , to exorcise the evil spirit . Rev . Stephen Bachiler or Batchelder was one of the ablest of the early New England preachers . His marriage late in life to a woman regarded by his church as disreputable induced him to return to England , where he enjoyed the esteem and favor of Oliver Cromwell during the Protectorate .</head>

     <l n="68">Smote the boat on its starboard side .</l>
     <l n="69">The Shoalsmen looked , but saw alone</l>
     <l n="70">Dark films of rain-cloud slantwise blown ,</l>
     <l n="71">Wild rocks lit up by the lightning 's glare ,</l>

    <head>THE BROTHER OF MERCY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Piero Luca , known of all the town</l>
     <l n="2">As the gray porter by the Pitti wall</l>
     <l n="3">Where the noon shadows of the gardens fall ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sick and in dolor , waited to lay down</l>
     <l n="5">His last sad burden , and beside his mat</l>
     <l n="6">The barefoot monk of La Certosa sat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Unseen , in square and blossoming garden drifted ,</l>
     <l n="8">Soft sunset lights through green Val d'Arno sifted ;</l>
     <l n="9">Unheard , below the living shuttles shifted</l>
     <l n="10">Backward and forth , and wove , in love or strife ,</l>
     <l n="11">In mirth or pain , the mottled web of life</l>
     <l n="12">But when at last came upward from the street</l>
     <l n="13">Tinkle of bell and tread of measured feet ,</l>
     <l n="14">The sick man started , strove to rise in vain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Sinking back heavily with a moan of pain .</l>
     <l n="16">And the monk said , “ ‘ T is but the Brotherhood</l>
     <l n="17">Of Mercy going on some errand good</l>
     <l n="18">Their black masks by the palace-wall I see . ”</l>
     <l n="19">Piero answered faintly , “ Woe is me !</l>
     <l n="20">This day for the first time in forty years</l>
     <l n="21">In vain the bell hath sounded in my ears ,</l>
     <l n="22">Calling me with my brethren of the mask ,</l>
     <l n="23">Beggar and prince alike , to some new task</l>
     <l n="24">Of love or pity ,— haply from the street</l>
     <l n="25">To bear a wretch plague-stricken , or , with feet</l>
     <l n="26">Hushed to the quickened ear and feverish brain ,</l>
     <l n="27">To tread the crowded lazaretto 's floors ,</l>
     <l n="28">Down the long twilight of the corridors ,</l>
     <l n="29">Midst tossing arms and faces full of pain .</l>
     <l n="30">I loved the work : it was its own reward .</l>
     <l n="31">I never counted on it to offset</l>
     <l n="32">My sins , which are many , or make less my debt</l>
     <l n="33">To the free grace and mercy of our Lord ;</l>
     <l n="34">But somehow , father , it has come to be</l>
     <l n="35">In these long years so much a part of me ,</l>
     <l n="36">I should not know myself , if lacking it ,</l>
     <l n="37">But with the work the worker too would die ,</l>
     <l n="38">And in my place some other self would sit</l>
     <l n="39">Joyful or sad ,— what matters , if not I ?</l>
     <l n="40">And now all 's over . Woe is me ! ” — “ My son , ”</l>
     <l n="41">The monk said soothingly , “ thy work is done ;</l>
     <l n="42">And no more as a servant , but the guest</l>
     <l n="43">Of God thou enterest thy eternal rest .</l>
     <l n="44">No toil , no tears , no sorrow for the lost ,</l>
     <l n="45">Shall mar thy perfect bliss . Thou shalt sit down</l>
     <l n="46">Clad in white robes , and wear a golden crown</l>
     <l n="47">Forever and forever . ” — Piero tossed</l>
     <l n="48">On his sick-pillow : “ Miserable me !</l>
     <l n="49">I am too poor for such grand company ;</l>
     <l n="50">The crown would be too heavy for this gray</l>
     <l n="51">Old head ; and God forgive me if I say</l>
     <l n="52">It would be hard to sit there night and day ,</l>
     <l n="53">Like an image in the Tribune , doing naught</l>
     <l n="54">With these hard hands , that all my life have wrought ,</l>
     <l n="55">Not for bread only , but for pity 's sake .</l>
     <l n="56">I 'm dull at prayers : I could not keep awake ,</l>
     <l n="57">Counting my beads . Mine 's but a crazy head ,</l>
     <l n="58">Scarce worth the saving , if all else be dead .</l>
     <l n="59">And if one goes to heaven without a heart ,</l>
     <l n="60">God knows he leaves behind his better part .</l>
     <l n="61">I love my fellow-men : the worst I know</l>
     <l n="62">I would do good to . Will death change me so</l>
     <l n="63">That I shall sit among the lazy saints ,</l>
     <l n="64">Turning a deaf ear to the sore complaints</l>
     <l n="65">Of souls that suffer ? Why , I never yet</l>
     <l n="66">Left a poor dog in the strada hard beset ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or ass o'erladen ! Must I rate man less</l>
     <l n="68">Than dog or ass , in holy selfishness ?</l>
     <l n="69">Methinks ( Lord , pardon , if the thought be sin ! )</l>
     <l n="70">The world of pain were better , if therein</l>
     <l n="71">One 's heart might still be human , and desires</l>
     <l n="72">Of natural pity drop upon its fires</l>
     <l n="73">Some cooling tears . ”</l>

     <l n="77">The sick man closed his eyes with a great groan</l>
     <l n="78">That sank into a prayer , “ Thy will be done ! ”</l>
     <l n="79">Then was he made aware , by soul or ear ,</l>

    <head>THE PALATINE .</head>
    <head>Block Island in Long Island Sound , called by the Indians Manisees , the isle of the little god , was the scene of a tragic incident a hundred years or more ago , when The Palatine , an emigrant ship bound for Philadelphia , driven off its course , came upon the coast at this point . A mutiny on board , followed by an inhuman desertion on the part of the crew , had brought the unhappy passengers to the verge of starvation and madness . Tradition says that wreckers on shore , after rescuing all but one of the survivors , set fire to the vessel , which was driven out to sea before a gale which had sprung up . Every twelvemonth , according to the same tradition , the spectacle of a ship on fire is visible to the inhabitants of the island .</head>

    <head>ABRAHAM DAVENPORT</head>
    <head>The famous Dark Day of New England , May 19 , 1780 , was a physical puzzle for many years to our ancestors , but its occurrence brought something more than philosophical speculation into the winds of those who passed through it . The incident of Colonel Abraham Davenport 's sturdy protest is a matter of history .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the old days ( a custom laid aside</l>
     <l n="2">With breeches and cocked hats ) the people sent</l>
     <l n="3">Their wisest men to make the public laws .</l>
     <l n="4">And so , from a brown homestead , where the Sound</l>
     <l n="5">Drinks the small tribute of the Mianas ,</l>
     <l n="6">Waved over by the woods of Rippowams ,</l>
     <l n="7">And hallowed by pure lives and tranquil deaths ,</l>
     <l n="8">Stamford sent up to the councils of the State</l>
     <l n="9">Wisdom and grace in Abraham Davenport .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">‘ T was on a May-day of the far old year</l>
     <l n="11">Seventeen hundred eighty , that there fell</l>
     <l n="12">Over the bloom and sweet life of the Spring ,</l>
     <l n="13">Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon ,</l>
     <l n="14">A horror of great darkness , like the night</l>
     <l n="15">In day of which the Norland sagas tell ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">The Twilight of the Gods . The low-hung sky</l>
     <l n="17">Was black with ominous clouds , save where its rim</l>
     <l n="18">Was fringed with a dull glow , like that which climbs</l>
     <l n="19">The crater 's sides from the red hell below .</l>
     <l n="20">Birds ceased to sing , and all the barn-yard fowls</l>
     <l n="21">Roosted ; the cattle at the pasture bars</l>
     <l n="22">Lowed , and looked homeward ; bats on leathern wings</l>
     <l n="23">Flitted abroad ; the sounds of labor died ;</l>
     <l n="24">Men prayed , and women wept ; all ears grew sharp</l>
     <l n="25">To hear the doom-blast of the trumpet shatter</l>
     <l n="26">The black sky , that the dreadful face of Christ</l>
     <l n="27">Might look from the rent clouds , not as he looked</l>

     <l n="33">“ It is the Lord 's Great Day ! Let us adjourn , ”</l>
     <l n="34">Some said ; and then , as if with one accord ,</l>
     <l n="35">All eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport .</l>
     <l n="36">He rose , slow cleaving with his steady voice</l>
     <l n="37">The intolerable hush . “ This well may be</l>
     <l n="38">The Day of Judgment which the world awaits ;</l>
     <l n="39">But be it so or not , I only know</l>
     <l n="40">My present duty , and my Lord 's command</l>

     <l n="42">Where He hath set me in His providence ,</l>
     <l n="43">I choose , for one , to meet Him face to face ,—</l>
     <l n="44">No faithless servant frightened from my task ,</l>
     <l n="45">But ready when the Lord of the harvest calls ;</l>

     <l n="49">Then by the flaring lights the Speaker read ,</l>
     <l n="50">Albeit with husky voice and shaking hands ,</l>

     <l n="52">The shad and alewive fisheries . Whereupon</l>
     <l n="53">Wisely and well spake Abraham Davenport ,</l>
     <l n="54">Straight to the question , with no figures of speech</l>
     <l n="55">Save the ten Arab signs , yet not without</l>

     <l n="57">His awe-struck colleagues listening all the while ,</l>
     <l n="58">Between the pauses of his argument ,</l>

    <head>AN OUTDOOR RECEPTION .</head>
    <head>The substance of these lines , hastily pencilled several years ago , I find among such of my unprinted scraps as have escaped the waste-basket and the fire . In transcribing it I have made some changes , additions , and omissions .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">On these green banks , where falls too soon</l>
     <l n="2">The shade of Autumn 's afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="3">The south wind blowing soft and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="4">The water gliding at nay feet ,</l>
     <l n="5">The distant northern range uplit</l>
     <l n="6">By the slant sunshine over it ,</l>
     <l n="7">With changes of the mountain mist</l>
     <l n="8">From tender blush to amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="9">The valley 's stretch of shade and gleam</l>
     <l n="10">Fair as in Mirza 's Bagdad dream ,</l>
     <l n="11">With glad young faces smiling near</l>

     <l n="15">For Persian roses blushing red ,</l>
     <l n="16">Aster and gentian bloom instead ;</l>
     <l n="17">For Shiraz wine , this mountain air ;</l>
     <l n="18">For feast , the blueberries which I share</l>
     <l n="19">With one who proffers with stained hands</l>
     <l n="20">Her gleanings from yon pasture lands ,</l>
     <l n="21">Wild fruit that art and culture spoil ,</l>
     <l n="22">The harvest of an untilled soil ;</l>

     <l n="24">Reflect the change of April skies ,</l>
     <l n="25">Midway ‘ twixt child and maiden yet ,</l>
     <l n="26">Fresh as Spring 's earliest violet ;</l>

    <head>THE LAST EVE OF SUMMER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Summer 's last sun nigh unto setting shines</l>
     <l n="2">Through yon columnar pines ,</l>
     <l n="3">And on the deepening shadows of the lawn</l>
     <l n="4">Its golden lines are drawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Dreaming of long gone summer days like this ,</l>
     <l n="6">Feeling the wind 's soft kiss ,</l>
     <l n="7">Grateful and glad that failing ear and sight</l>
     <l n="8">Have still their old delight ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I sit alone , and watch the warm , sweet day</l>
     <l n="10">Lapse tenderly away ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , wistful , with a feeling of forecast ,</l>
     <l n="12">I ask , “ Is this the last ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Will nevermore for me the seasons run</l>
     <l n="14">Their round , and will the sun</l>
     <l n="15">Of ardent summers yet to come forget</l>
     <l n="16">For me to rise and set ? ”</l>

     <l n="17">Thou shouldst be here , or I should be with thee</l>
     <l n="18">Wherever thou mayst be ,</l>
     <l n="19">Lips mute , hands clasped , in silences of speech</l>
     <l n="20">Each answering unto each .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">For this still hour , this sense of mystery far</l>
     <l n="22">Beyond the evening star ,</l>
     <l n="23">No words outworn suffice on lip or scroll :</l>
     <l n="24">The soul would fain with soul</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Wait , while these few swift-passing days fulfil</l>
     <l n="26">The wise-disposing Will ,</l>
     <l n="27">And , in the evening as at morning , trust</l>
     <l n="28">The All-Merciful and Just .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">The solemn joy that soul-communion feels</l>
     <l n="30">Immortal life reveals ;</l>
     <l n="31">And human love , its prophecy and sign ,</l>
     <l n="32">Interprets love divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Come then , in thought , if that alone may be ,</l>
     <l n="34">O friend ! and bring with thee</l>
     <l n="35">Thy calm assurance of transcendent Spheres</l>
     <l n="36">And the Eternal Years !</l>
