    <head>BOOK I .</head>
    <head>SIGMUND .</head>
    <head>IN THIS BOOK IS TOLD OF THE EARLIER DAYS OF THE VOLSUNGS , AND OF SIGMUND THE FATHER OF SIGURD , AND OF HIS DEEDS , AND OF HOW HE DIED WHILE SIGURD WAS YET UNBORN IN HIS MOTHER 'S WOMB .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of the dwelling of King Volsung , and the wedding of Signy his</l>
     <l n="2">daughter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old ;</l>
     <l n="4">Dukes were the door-wards there , and the roofs were thatched with gold ;</l>
     <l n="5">Earls were the wrights that wrought it , and silver nailed its doors ;</l>
     <l n="6">Earls ’ wives were the weaving-women , queens ’ daughters strewed its</l>
     <l n="7">floors ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast</l>
     <l n="9">The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast .</l>
     <l n="10">There dwelt men merry-hearted , and in hope exceeding great</l>
     <l n="11">Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate :</l>
     <l n="12">There the Gods were unforgotten , yea whiles they walked with men .</l>
     <l n="13">Though e'en in that world 's beginning rose a murmur now and again</l>
     <l n="14">Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the entering in of the terror , and the death of the People 's</l>
     <l n="16">Praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Thus was the dwelling of Volsung , the King of the Midworld 's Mark ,</l>
     <l n="18">As a rose in the winter season , a candle in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="19">And as in all other matters ‘ twas all earthly houses ’ crown ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world 's renown ,</l>
     <l n="21">So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see ,</l>
     <l n="22">For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree ,</l>
     <l n="23">That reared its blessings roofward , and wreathed the roof-tree dear</l>
     <l n="24">With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year .</l>
     <l n="25">I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life ,</l>
     <l n="26">But his dawning of fair promise , and his noontide of the strife ,</l>
     <l n="27">His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame ,</l>
     <l n="28">Have bred us many a story and named us many a name ;</l>
     <l n="29">And when men tell of Volsung , they call that war-duke 's tree ,</l>
     <l n="30">That crownèd stem , the Branstock ; and so was it told unto me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower .</l>
     <l n="32">But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose ‘ twixt tower and tower ,</l>
     <l n="33">And therein were the wild hawks dwelling , abiding the dole of</l>
     <l n="34">their lord ;</l>
     <l n="35">And they wailed high over the wine , and laughed to the waking sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="36">Still were its boughs but for them , when lo on an even of May</l>
     <l n="37">Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say :</l>
     <l n="38">“ All hail to thee King Volsung , from the King of the Goths I come :</l>
     <l n="39">He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home ;</l>
     <l n="40">He hath heard of thy sons in the battle , the fillers of Odin 's Hall ;</l>
     <l n="41">And a word hath the west-wind blown him , ( full fruitful be its fall ! )</l>
     <l n="42">A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood :</l>
     <l n="43">Now he deems thy friendship goodly , and thine help in the battle good ,</l>
     <l n="44">And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again :</l>
     <l n="45">But if thou wouldst grant his asking , and make his heart full fain ,</l>
     <l n="46">Then shalt thou give him a matter , saith he , without a price ,</l>
     <l n="47">— Signy the fairer than fair , Signy the wiser than wise . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="48">Such words in the hall of the Volsungs spake the Earl of Siggeir</l>
     <l n="49">the Goth ,</l>
     <l n="50">Bearing the gifts and the gold , the ring , and the tokens of troth .</l>
     <l n="51">But the King 's heart laughed within him and the King 's sons deemed</l>
     <l n="52">it good ;</l>
     <l n="53">For they dreamed how they fared with the Goths o'er ocean and acre</l>
     <l n="54">and wood ,</l>
     <l n="55">Till all the north was theirs , and the utmost southern lands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="56">But nought said the snow-white Signy as she sat with folded hands</l>
     <l n="57">And gazed at the Goth-king 's Earl till his heart grew heavy and cold ,</l>
     <l n="58">As one that half remembers a tale that the elders have told ,</l>
     <l n="59">A story of weird and of woe : then spake King Volsung and said :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="60">“ A great king woos thee , daughter ; wilt thou lie in a great king 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="61">And bear earth 's kings on thy bosom , that our name may never die ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A fire lit up her face , and her voice was e'en as a cry : “ I will sleep in a great king 's bed , I will bear the lords of the earth , And the wrack and the grief of my youth-days shall be held for nothing worth . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then would he question her kindly , as one who loved her sore ,</l>
     <l n="2">But she put forth her hand and smiled , and her face was flushed no more</l>
     <l n="3">“ Would God it might otherwise be ! but wert thou to will it not ,</l>
     <l n="4">Yet should I will it and wed him , and rue my life and my lot . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Lowly and soft she said it ; but spake out louder now :</l>
     <l n="6">“ Be of good cheer , King Volsung ! for such a man art thou ,</l>
     <l n="7">That what thou dost well-counselled , goodly and fair it is ,</l>
     <l n="8">And what thou dost unwitting , the Gods have bidden thee this :</l>
     <l n="9">So work all things together for the fame of thee and thine .</l>
     <l n="10">And now meseems at my wedding shall be a hallowed sign ,</l>
     <l n="11">That shall give thine heart a joyance , whatever shall follow after . ”</l>
     <l n="12">She spake , and the feast sped on , and the speech and the song and</l>
     <l n="13">the laughter</l>
     <l n="14">Went over the words of boding as the tide of the norland main</l>
     <l n="15">Sweeps over the hidden skerry , the home of the shipman 's bane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">So wendeth his way on the morrow that Earl of the Gothland King ,</l>
     <l n="17">Bearing the gifts and the gold , and King Volsung 's tokening ,</l>
     <l n="18">And a word in his mouth moreover , a word of blessing and hail ,</l>
     <l n="19">And a bidding to King Siggeir to come ere the June-tide fail</l>
     <l n="20">And wed him to white-hand Signy and bear away his bride ,</l>
     <l n="21">While sleepeth the field of the fishes amidst the summer-tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began</l>
     <l n="23">Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan</l>
     <l n="24">Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about ;</l>
     <l n="25">There through the glimmering thicket the linkèd mail rang out ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford :</l>
     <l n="27">There were gold-rings God-fashioned , and many a Dwarf-wrought sword ,</l>
     <l n="28">And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear ;</l>
     <l n="29">So came they to the acres , and drew the threshold near ,</l>
     <l n="30">And amidst of the garden blossoms , on the grassy , fruit-grown land ,</l>
     <l n="31">Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand ;</l>
     <l n="32">Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk ,</l>
     <l n="33">Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak ,</l>
     <l n="34">Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung 's sons .</l>
     <l n="35">And so into the hall they wended , the Kings and their mighty ones ;</l>
     <l n="36">And they dight the feast full glorious , and drank through the</l>
     <l n="37">death of the day ,</l>
     <l n="38">Till the shadowless moon rose upward , till it wended white away ;</l>
     <l n="39">Then they went to the gold-hung beds , and at last for an hour or twain</l>
     <l n="40">Were all things still and silent , save a flaw of the summer rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare ,</l>
     <l n="42">More glorious was the banquet , and now was Signy there ,</l>
     <l n="43">And she sat beside King Siggeir , a glorious bride forsooth ;</l>
     <l n="44">Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast 's tooth ,</l>
     <l n="45">But she neither laughed nor spake , and her eyes were hard and cold ,</l>
     <l n="46">And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold .</l>
     <l n="47">That saw Sigmund her brother , the eldest Volsung son ,</l>
     <l n="48">And oft he looked upon her , and their eyes met now and anon ,</l>
     <l n="49">And ruth arose in his heart , and hate of Siggeir the Goth ,</l>
     <l n="50">And there had he broken the wedding , but for plighted promise and</l>
     <l n="51">troth .</l>
     <l n="52">But those twain were beheld of Siggeir , and he deemed of the</l>
     <l n="53">Volsung kin ,</l>
     <l n="54">That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yet thereof made he no semblance , but abided times to be</l>
     <l n="56">And laughed out with the loudest , amid the hope and the glee .</l>
     <l n="57">And nought of all saw Volsung , as he dreamed of the coming glory ,</l>
     <l n="58">And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world 's</l>
     <l n="59">story .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="60">So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold ;</l>
     <l n="61">And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old ,</l>
     <l n="62">Yet had they tales for songcraft , and the blossomed garth of rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="63">Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time</l>
     <l n="64">From the halls of the outer heaven ; so near they knew the door .</l>
     <l n="65">Wherefore uprose a sea-king , and his hands that loved the oar</l>
     <l n="66">Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold , and he sang of the shaping</l>
     <l n="67">of earth ,</l>
     <l n="68">And how the stars were lighted , and where the winds had birth ,</l>
     <l n="69">And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass .</l>
     <l n="70">But e'en as men 's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass</l>
     <l n="71">O'er the cloudless noontide heaven ; and some men turned about</l>
     <l n="72">And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out .</l>
     <l n="73">Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode ,</l>
     <l n="74">One-eyed and seeming ancient , yet bright his visage glowed :</l>
     <l n="75">Cloud-blue was the hood upon him , and his kirtle gleaming-grey</l>
     <l n="76">As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way :</l>
     <l n="77">A bill he bore on his shoulder , whose mighty ashen beam</l>
     <l n="78">Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver 's gleam .</l>
     <l n="79">And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told</l>
     <l n="80">Was borne by their fathers ’ fathers , and the first that warred in</l>
     <l n="81">the wold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="82">So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord ,</l>
     <l n="83">But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword ,</l>
     <l n="84">And smote it deep in the tree-bole , and the wild hawks overhead</l>
     <l n="85">Laughed ‘ neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said :</l>
     <l n="86">“ Earls of the Goths , and Volsungs , abiders on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="87">Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth !</l>
     <l n="88">The folk of the war-wand 's forgers wrought never better steel</l>
     <l n="89">Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk 's weal .</l>
     <l n="90">Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift</l>
     <l n="91">To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift .</l>
     <l n="92">Then ne'er , but his own heart falter , its point and edge shall fail</l>
     <l n="93">Until the night 's beginning and the ending of the tale .</l>
     <l n="94">Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk , O Volsung Sons be wise ,</l>
     <l n="95">And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies :</l>
     <l n="96">For they told me in the wild wood , I heard on the mountain side ,</l>
     <l n="97">That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide ,</l>
     <l n="98">And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest</l>
     <l n="99">While Earth grows scant of great ones , and fadeth from its best ,</l>
     <l n="100">And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile :—</l>
     <l n="101">All hail to thee King Volsung ! farewell for a little while ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="102">So sweet his speaking sounded , so wise his words did seem ,</l>
     <l n="103">That moveless all men sat there , as in a happy dream</l>
     <l n="104">We stir not lest we waken ; but there his speech had end ,</l>
     <l n="105">And slowly down the hall-floor , and outward did he wend ;</l>
     <l n="106">And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways ,</l>
     <l n="107">For they knew that the gift was Odin 's , a sword for the world to</l>
     <l n="108">praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="109">But now spake Volsung the King : “ Why sit ye silent and still ?</l>
     <l n="110">Is the Battle-Father 's visage a token of terror and ill ?</l>
     <l n="111">Arise O Volsung Children , Earls of the Goths arise ,</l>
     <l n="112">And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise !</l>
     <l n="113">Yet deem it not too easy ; for belike a fateful blade</l>
     <l n="114">Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="115">Now therewith spake King Siggeir : “ King Volsung give me a grace</l>
     <l n="116">To try it the first of all men , lest another win my place</l>
     <l n="117">And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="118">Then somewhat laughed King Volsung , and he said : “ O Guest , begin ;</l>
     <l n="119">Though herein is the first as the last , for the Gods have long to live ,</l>
     <l n="120">Nor hath Odin yet forgotten unto whom the gift he would give . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="121">Then forth to the tree went Siggeir , the Goth-folk 's mighty lord ,</l>
     <l n="122">And laid his hand on the gemstones , and strained at the glorious sword</l>
     <l n="123">Till his heart grew black with anger ; and never a word he said</l>
     <l n="124">As he wended back to the high-seat : but Signy waxed blood-red</l>
     <l n="125">When he sat him adown beside her ; and her heart was nigh to break</l>
     <l n="126">For the shame and the fateful boding : and therewith King Volsung spake :</l>

     <l n="127">“ Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth ,</l>

     <l n="129">And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring</l>
     <l n="130">To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King :</l>
     <l n="131">So stand forth free and unfree ; stand forth both most and least :</l>
     <l n="132">But first ye Earls of the Goth-folk , ye lovely lords we feast . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="133">Upstood the Earls of Siggeir , and each man drew anigh</l>
     <l n="134">And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high ;</l>
     <l n="135">But for all their mighty shaping and their deeds in the battle-wood ,</l>
     <l n="136">No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood .</l>
     <l n="137">Then uprose Volsung 's homemen , and the fell-abiding folk ;</l>
     <l n="138">And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak ,</l>
     <l n="139">And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar :</l>
     <l n="140">And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war .</l>
     <l n="141">But for all their mighty shaping , and the struggle and the strain</l>
     <l n="142">Of their hands , the deft in labour , they tugged thereat in vain ;</l>
     <l n="143">And still as the shouting and jeers , and the names of men and the</l>

     <l n="145">Beat backward from gable to gable , and rattled o'er roofhYpppHeNtree and</l>

     <l n="147">Moody and still sat Siggeir ; for he said : “ They have trained me here</l>
     <l n="148">As a mock for their woodland bondsmen ; and yet shall they buy it dear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="149">Now the tumult sank a little , and men cried on Volsung the King</l>
     <l n="150">And his sons , the hedge of battle , to try the fateful thing .</l>
     <l n="151">So Volsung laughed , and answered : “ I will set me to the toil ,</l>
     <l n="152">Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil .</l>
     <l n="153">Yet nought am I ill-sworded , and the oldest friend is best ;</l>
     <l n="154">And this , my hand 's first fellow , will I bear to the grave-mound 's</l>
     <l n="155">rest ,</l>
     <l n="156">Nor wield meanwhile another : Yea this shall I have in hand</l>
     <l n="157">When mid the host of Odin in the Day of Doom I stand . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="158">Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath ,</l>
     <l n="159">And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death :</l>
     <l n="160">Then he laid his hand on the Branstock , and cried : “ O tree beloved ,</l>
     <l n="161">I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved :</l>
     <l n="162">Abide thou thus , green bower , when I am dead and gone</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="164">Then as a young man laughed he , and on the hilts of gold</l>
     <l n="165">His hand , the battle-breaker , took fast and certain hold ,</l>
     <l n="166">And long he drew and strained him , but mended not the tale ,</l>
     <l n="167">Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail ;</l>

     <l n="185">A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall ,</l>

     <l n="195">He lifted his eyes as he thought it , for now was he come to his place ,</l>

     <l n="208">When they sell me the woven wonder , the purple born of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="209">And it hangeth up in that bower ; and all this is a gift for thee :</l>
     <l n="210">But the sword that came to my wedding , methinketh it meet and right ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="212">But Sigmund laughed and answered , and he spake a scornful word :</l>

     <l n="222">Black then was the heart of Siggeir , but his face grew pale and red ,</l>

     <l n="224">“ Nay , pardon me , Signy 's kinsman ! when the heart desires o'ermuch</l>

     <l n="230">To come to the house of the Goth-kings as honoured guests and dear</l>
     <l n="231">And abide the winter over ; that the dusky days and drear</l>

     <l n="233">And the friends that my fame hath gotten ; and that this my new-wed wife</l>
     <l n="234">Thine eyes may make the merrier till she bear my eldest born . ”</l>
     <l n="235">Then speedily answered Volsung : “ No king of the earth might scorn</l>

     <l n="237">To look upon thy glory and the Goths ’ abundant home .</l>
     <l n="238">But let two months wear over , for I have many a thing</l>

     <l n="243">shields</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="245">Answered the smooth-speeched Siggeir : “ I thank thee well for this ,</l>
     <l n="246">And thy bidding is most kingly ; yet take it not amiss</l>
     <l n="247">That I wend my ways in the morning ; for we Goth-folk know indeed</l>
     <l n="248">That the sea is a foe full deadly , and a friend that fails at need ,</l>
     <l n="249">And that Ran who dwells thereunder will many a man beguile :</l>
     <l n="250">And I bear a woman with me ; nor would I for a while</l>

     <l n="253">In the arms of the fairest woman that ever a king may kiss .</l>
     <l n="254">So I go mine house to order for the increase of thy bliss ,</l>
     <l n="255">That there in nought but joyance all we may wear the days</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="257">And for all the words of Volsung e'en so must the matter be ,</l>
     <l n="258">And Siggeir the Goth and Signy on the morn shall sail the sea .</l>
     <l n="259">But the feast sped on the fairer , and the more they waxed in disport</l>
     <l n="260">And the glee that all men love , as they knew that the hours were short .</l>
     <l n="261">Yet a boding heart bare Sigmund amid his singing and laughter ;</l>

     <l n="263">For the wisest of women she was , and many a thing she knew ;</l>
     <l n="264">She would hearken the voice of the midnight till she heard what the</l>

     <l n="266">And her feet fared oft on the wild , and deep was her communing</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="268">So fair sped on the feasting amid the gleam of the gold ,</l>
     <l n="269">Amid the wine and the joyance ; and many a tale was told</l>
     <l n="270">To the harp-strings of that wedding , whereof the latter days</l>
     <l n="271">Yet hold a little glimmer to wonder at and praise .</l>
     <l n="272">Then the undark night drew over , and faint the high stars shone ,</l>
     <l n="273">And there on the beds blue-woven the slumber-tide they won ;</l>
     <l n="274">Yea while on the brightening mountain the herd-boy watched his sheep .</l>
     <l n="275">Yet soft on the breast of Signy King Siggeir lay asleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="276">How the Volsungs fared to the Land of the Goths , and of the fall of</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="278">Now or ever the sun shone houseward , unto King Volsung 's bed</l>
     <l n="279">Came Signy stealing barefoot , and she spake the word and said :</l>
     <l n="280">“ Awake and hearken , my father , for though the wedding be done ,</l>
     <l n="281">And I am the wife of the Goth-king , yet the Volsungs are not gone .</l>
     <l n="282">So I come as a dream of the night , with a word that the Gods would say ,</l>
     <l n="283">And think thou thereof in the day-tide , and let Siggeir go on his way</l>
     <l n="284">With me and the gifts and the gold , but do ye abide in the land ,</l>
     <l n="285">Nor trust in the guileful heart and the murder-loving hand ,</l>
     <l n="286">Lest the kin of the Volsungs perish , and the world be nothing worth . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="287">So came the word unto Volsung , and wit in his heart had birth ;</l>
     <l n="288">And he sat upright in the bed and kissed her on the lips ;</l>
     <l n="289">But he said : “ My word is given , it is gone like the spring-tide ships :</l>
     <l n="290">To death or to life must I journey when the months are come to an end .</l>
     <l n="291">Yet my sons my words shall hearken , and shall nowise with me wend . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="292">Then she answered , speaking swiftly : “ Nay , have thy sons with thee ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="295">He said : “ Nay , my troth-word plighted e'en so should I draw aback :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="298">Then answered Signy , weeping : “ I shall see thee yet again</l>

     <l n="300">Heavy and hard are the Norns : but each man his burden bears ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="302">She wept and she wended back to the Goth-king 's bolster blue ,</l>

     <l n="304">But when once more he wakened , the kingly house was up ,</l>
     <l n="305">And the homemen gathered together to drink the parting cup :</l>
     <l n="306">And grand amid the hall-floor was the Goth king in his gear ,</l>
     <l n="307">And Signy clad for faring stood by the Branstock dear</l>
     <l n="308">With the earls of the Goths about her : so queenly did she seem ,</l>
     <l n="309">So calm and ruddy coloured , that Volsung well might deem</l>
     <l n="310">That her words were a fashion of slumber , a vision of the night .</l>
     <l n="311">But they drank the wine of departing , and brought the horses dight ,</l>
     <l n="312">And forth abroad the Goth-folk and the Volsung Children rode ,</l>
     <l n="313">Nor ever once would Signy look back to that abode .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="314">So down over acre and heath they rode to the side of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="315">And there by the long-ships ’ bridges was the ship-host 's company .</l>
     <l n="316">Then Signy kissed her brethren with ruddy mouth and warm ,</l>
     <l n="317">Nor was there one of the Goth-folk but blessed her from all harm ;</l>
     <l n="318">Then sweet she kissed her father and hung about his neck ,</l>
     <l n="319">And sure she whispered him somewhat ere she passed forth toward the</l>

     <l n="321">Though nought I know to tell it : then Siggeir hailed them fair ,</l>
     <l n="322">And called forth many a blessing on the hearts that bode his snare .</l>
     <l n="323">Then were the gangways shipped , and blown was the parting horn ,</l>
     <l n="324">And the striped sails drew with the wind , and away was Signy borne</l>
     <l n="325">White on the shielded long-ship , a grief in the heart of the gold ;</l>
     <l n="326">Nor once would she turn her about the strand of her folk to behold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="327">Thenceforward dwelt the Volsungs in exceeding glorious state ,</l>

     <l n="329">But when the months aforesaid were well-nigh worn away</l>
     <l n="330">To his sons and his folk of counsel he fell these words to say :</l>

     <l n="332">To go in two months ’ wearing to the house of Siggeir the Goth :</l>
     <l n="333">Nor will I hide how Signy then spake a warning word</l>

     <l n="335">And would draw us to our undoing for envy and despite</l>

     <l n="337">Now wise is Signy my daughter and knoweth nought but sooth :</l>

     <l n="341">Nor altogether doubt it , since the woman is wrought so wise ;</l>
     <l n="342">Nor much might my heart love Siggeir for all his kingly guise .</l>
     <l n="343">Yet , shall a king hear murder when a king 's mouth blessing saith ?</l>
     <l n="344">So maybe he is bidding me honour , and maybe he is bidding me death :</l>
     <l n="345">Let him do after his fashion , and I will do no less .</l>
     <l n="346">In peace will I go to his bidding let the spae-wrights ban or bless ;</l>
     <l n="347">And no man now or hereafter of Volsung 's blenching shall tell .</l>
     <l n="348">But ye , sons , in the land shall tarry , and heed the realm right well ,</l>

     <l n="10">And or ever she reached the wild-wood the night was waxen deep</l>
     <l n="11">No man she had to lead her , but the path was trodden well</l>
     <l n="12">By those messengers of murder , the men with the tale to tell ;</l>
     <l n="13">And the beams of the high white moon gave a glimmering day through</l>
     <l n="14">night</l>
     <l n="15">Till she came where that lawn of the woods lay wide in the flood of</l>
     <l n="16">light .</l>
     <l n="17">Then she looked , and lo , in its midmost a mighty man there stood ,</l>
     <l n="18">And laboured the earth of the green-sward with a truncheon torn from</l>
     <l n="19">the wood ;</l>
     <l n="20">And behold , it was Sigmund the Volsung : but she cried and had no fear :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ If thou art living , Sigmund , what day 's work dost thou here In the midnight and the forest ? but if thou art nought but a ghost , Then where are those Volsung brethren , of whom thou wert best and most ? ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then he turned about unto her , and his raiment was fouled and torn ,</l>
     <l n="2">And his eyen were great and hollow , as a famished man forlorn ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">But he cried : “ Hail , Sister Signy ! I looked for thee before ,</l>
     <l n="4">Though what should a woman compass , she one alone and no more ,</l>
     <l n="5">When all we shielded Volsungs did nought in Siggeir 's land ?</l>
     <l n="6">O yea , I am living indeed , and this labour of mine hand</l>
     <l n="7">Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs ; and lo , it is well-nigh done .</l>
     <l n="8">So draw near , Volsung 's daughter , and pile we many a stone</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">So she set her hand to the labour , and they toiled , they twain in</l>
     <l n="11">the wood</l>
     <l n="12">And when the work was over , dead night was beginning to fail :</l>
     <l n="13">Then spake the white-hand Signy : “ Now shalt thou tell the tale</l>
     <l n="14">Of the death of the Volsung brethren ere the wood thy wrath shall hide ,</l>
     <l n="15">Ere I wend me back sick-hearted in the dwelling of kings to abide . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">He said : “ We sat on the tree , and well ye may wot indeed</l>
     <l n="17">That we had some hope from thy good-will amidst that bitter need .</l>
     <l n="18">Now none had ‘ scaped the sword-edge in the battle utterly ,</l>
     <l n="19">And so hurt were Agnar and Helgi , that , unhelped , they were like to</l>
     <l n="20">die ;</l>
     <l n="21">Though for that we deemed them happier : but now when the moon shone</l>
     <l n="22">bright ,</l>
     <l n="23">And when by a doomed man 's deeming ‘ twas the midmost of the night ,</l>
     <l n="24">Lo , forth from yonder thicket were two mighty wood-wolves come ,</l>
     <l n="25">Far huger wrought to my deeming than the beasts I knew at home :</l>
     <l n="26">Forthright on Gylfi and Geirmund those dogs of the forest fell ,</l>
     <l n="27">And what of men so hoppled should be the tale to tell ?</l>
     <l n="28">They tore them midst the irons , and slew them then and there ,</l>
     <l n="29">And long we heard them snarling o'er that abundant cheer .</l>
     <l n="30">Night after night , O my sister , the story was the same ,</l>
     <l n="31">And still from the dark and the thicket the wild-wood were-wolves came</l>
     <l n="32">And slew two men of the Volsungs whom the sword edge might not end .</l>
     <l n="33">And every day in the dawning did the King 's own woodmen wend</l>
     <l n="34">To behold those craftsmen 's carving and rejoice King Siggeir 's heart .</l>
     <l n="35">And so was come last midnight , when I must play my part :</l>
     <l n="36">Forsooth when those first were murdered my heart was as blood and fire ;</l>
     <l n="37">And I deemed that my bonds must burst with my uttermost desire</l>
     <l n="38">To free my naked hands , that the vengeance might be wrought ;</l>
     <l n="39">But now was I wroth with the Gods , that had made the Volsungs for</l>
     <l n="40">nought</l>
     <l n="41">And I said : in the Day of their Doom a man 's help shall they miss ;</l>
     <l n="42">I will be as a wolf of the forest , if their kings must come to this ;</l>
     <l n="43">Or if Siggeir indeed be their king , and their envy has brought it about</l>
     <l n="44">That dead in the dust lies Volsung , while the last of his seed dies</l>
     <l n="45">out .</l>
     <l n="46">Therewith from out the thicket the grey wolves drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="47">And the he-wolf fell on Sigi , but he gave forth never a cry ,</l>
     <l n="48">And I saw his lips that they smiled , and his steady eyes for a space ;</l>
     <l n="49">And therewith was the she-wolf 's muzzle thrust into my very face .</l>
     <l n="50">The Gods helped not , but I helped ; and I too grew wolfish then ;</l>
     <l n="51">Yea I , who have borne the sword-hilt high mid the kings of men ,</l>
     <l n="52">I , lord of the golden harness , the flame of the Glittering Heath ,</l>
     <l n="53">Must snarl to the she-wolf 's snarling , and snap with greedy teeth ,</l>
     <l n="54">While my hands with the hand-bonds struggled ; my teeth took hold the</l>
     <l n="55">first</l>
     <l n="56">And amid her mighty writhing the bonds that bound me burst ,</l>
     <l n="57">As with Fenrir 's Wolf it shall be : then the beast with the hopples I</l>
     <l n="58">smote ,</l>
     <l n="59">When my left hand stiff with the bonds had got her by the throat .</l>
     <l n="60">But I turned when I had slain her , and there lay Sigi dead ,</l>
     <l n="61">And once more to the night of the forest the fretting wolf had fled .</l>
     <l n="62">In the thicket I hid till the dawning , and thence I saw the men ,</l>
     <l n="63">E'en Siggeir 's heart-rejoicers , come back to the place again</l>
     <l n="64">To gather the well-loved tidings : I looked and I knew for sooth</l>

     <l n="140">Till all his heart was softened ; and the man was all alone ,</l>
     <l n="141">And in many wise she wooed him ; so they parted not that night ,</l>

     <l n="151">But no long while with Sigmund dwelt remembrance of that night ;</l>

     <l n="153">It fled like the dove in the forest or the down upon the blast :</l>
     <l n="154">Yet heavy and sad were the years , that even in suchwise passed ,</l>
     <l n="155">As here it is written aforetime .</l>
     <l n="156">Thence were ten years worn by</l>
     <l n="157">When unto that hidden river a man-child drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="158">And he looked and beheld how Sigmund wrought on a helm of gold</l>
     <l n="159">By the crag and the stony dwelling where the Dwarf-kin wrought of old .</l>
     <l n="160">Then the boy cried : “ Thou art the wood-wight of whom my mother spake ;</l>
     <l n="161">Now will I come to thy dwelling . ”</l>
     <l n="162">So the rough stream did he take ,</l>
     <l n="163">And the welter of the waters rose up to his chin and more ;</l>
     <l n="164">But so stark and strong he waded that he won the further shore :</l>
     <l n="165">And he came and gazed on Sigmund : but the Volsung laughed , and said :</l>
     <l n="166">“ As fast thou runnest toward me as others in their dread</l>
     <l n="167">Run over the land and the water : what wilt thou , son of a king ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="168">But the lad still gazed on Sigmund , and he said : “ A wondrous thing !</l>
     <l n="169">Here is the cave and the river , and all tokens of the place :</l>
     <l n="170">But my mother Signy told me none might behold that face ,</l>
     <l n="171">And keep his flesh from quaking : but at thee I quake not aught :</l>
     <l n="172">Sure I must journey further , lest her errand come to nought :</l>
     <l n="173">Yet I would that my foster-father should be such a man as thou . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="174">But Sigmund answered and said : “ Thou shalt bide in my dwelling now ;</l>
     <l n="175">And thou mayst wot full surely that thy mother 's will is done</l>
     <l n="176">By this token and no other , that thou lookedst on Volsung 's son</l>
     <l n="177">And smiledst fair in his face : but tell me thy name and thy years :</l>
     <l n="178">And what are the words of Signy that the son of the Goth-king bears ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="179">“ Sinfiotli they call me , ” he said , “ and ten summers have I seen ;</l>
     <l n="180">And this is the only word that I bear from Signy the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="181">That once more a man she sendeth the work of thine hands to speed ,</l>
     <l n="182">If he be of the Kings or the Gods thyself shalt know in thy need . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="183">So Sigmund looked on the youngling and his heart unto him yearned ;</l>
     <l n="184">But he thought : “ Shall I pay the hire ere the worth of the work be</l>
     <l n="185">earned ?</l>
     <l n="186">And what hath my heart to do to cherish Siggeir 's son ;</l>
     <l n="187">A brand belike for the burning when the last of its work is done ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="188">But there in the wild and the thicket those twain awhile abode ,</l>
     <l n="189">And on the lad laid Sigmund full many a weary load ,</l>
     <l n="190">And thrust him mid all dangers , and he bore all passing well ,</l>
     <l n="191">Where hardihood might help him ; but his heart was fierce and fell ;</l>
     <l n="192">And ever said Sigmund the Volsung : The lad hath plenteous part</l>
     <l n="193">In the guile and malice of Siggeir , and in Signy 's hardy heart :</l>
     <l n="194">But why should I cherish and love him , since the end must come at last ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="195">Now a summer and winter and spring o'er those men of the wilds had</l>
     <l n="196">pass 'd .</l>
     <l n="197">And summer was there again , when the Volsung spake on a day :</l>
     <l n="198">“ I will wend to the wood-deer 's hunting , but thou at home shalt stay ,</l>
     <l n="199">And deal with the baking of bread against the even come . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So he went and came on the hunting and brought the venison home , And the child , as ever his wont was , was glad of his coming back , And said : “ Thou hast gotten us venison , and the bread shall nowise lack . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Yea , ” quoth Sigmund the Volsung , “ hast thou kneaded the meal that</l>
     <l n="2">was yonder ? ”</l>
     <l n="3">“ Yea , and what other ? ” he said ; “ though therein forsooth was a wonder :</l>
     <l n="4">For when I would handle the meal-sack therein was something quick ,</l>
     <l n="5">As if the life of an eel-grig were set in an ashen stick :</l>
     <l n="6">But the meal must into the oven , since we were lacking bread ,</l>
     <l n="7">And all that is kneaded together , and the wonder is baked and dead . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then Sigmund laughed and answered : “ Thou hast kneaded up therein The deadliest of all adders that is of the creeping kin : So tonight from the bread refrain thee , lest thy bane should come of it . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For here , the tale of the elders doth men a marvel to wit ,</l>
     <l n="2">That such was the shaping of Sigmund among all earthly kings ,</l>
     <l n="3">That unhurt he handled adders and other deadly things ,</l>
     <l n="4">And might drink unscathed of venom : but Sinfiotli so was wrought ,</l>
     <l n="5">That no sting of creeping creatures would harm his body aught .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">But now full glad was Sigmund , and he let his love arise</l>
     <l n="7">For the huge-limbed son of Signy with the fierce and eager eyes ;</l>
     <l n="8">And all deeds of the sword he learned him , and showed him feats of war</l>
     <l n="9">Where sea and forest mingle , and up from the ocean 's shore</l>
     <l n="10">The highway leads to the market , and men go up and down ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the spear-hedged wains of the merchants fare oft to the</l>

     <l n="13">Sweet then Sinfiotli deemed it to look on the bale-fires ’ light ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the bickering blood-reeds ’ tangle , and the fallow blades of fight .</l>
     <l n="15">And in three years ’ space were his war-deeds far more than the deeds</l>
     <l n="16">of a man :</l>
     <l n="17">But dread was his face to behold ere the battle-play began ,</l>
     <l n="18">And grey and dreadful his face when the last of the battle sank .</l>
     <l n="19">And so the years won over , and the joy of the woods they drank ,</l>
     <l n="20">And they gathered gold and silver , and plenteous outland goods .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">But they came to a house on a day in the uttermost part of the woods</l>

     <l n="24">In slumber as deep as the death ; and gold rings great and fair</l>
     <l n="25">Those sleepers bore on their bodies , and broidered southland gear ,</l>

     <l n="27">Then the drift of a cloudy dream wrapt Sigmund 's soul away ,</l>

     <l n="30">That the Gods should miss a man in the utmost Day of Doom ,</l>
     <l n="31">And win a wolf in his stead ; and unto his heart came home</l>
     <l n="32">That thought , as he gazed on the wolf-skin and the other days waxed</l>
     <l n="33">dim ,</l>
     <l n="34">And he gathered the thing in his hand , and did it over him ;</l>
     <l n="35">And in likewise did Sinfiotli as he saw his fosterer do .</l>
     <l n="36">Then lo , a fearful wonder , for as very wolves they grew</l>
     <l n="37">In outward shape and semblance , and they howled out wolfish things ,</l>
     <l n="38">Like the grey dogs of the forest ; though somewhat the hearts of kings</l>
     <l n="39">Abode in their bodies of beasts . Now sooth is the tale to tell ,</l>
     <l n="40">That the men in the fair-wrought raiment were kings ’ sons bound by a</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">So Sigmund and his fellow rush forth from the golden place ;</l>

     <l n="47">Yet their wolfish habit drave them wide through the wood to range ,</l>

     <l n="49">And lo now , a band of hunters on the uttermost woodland way ,</l>

     <l n="61">thicket he broke ;</l>
     <l n="62">Then rose the axes aloft , and the swords flashed bright in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="63">And but little more it needed that the race of the Volsungs was done ,</l>

     <l n="66">Now Sinfiotli fay weary and faint , but Sigmund howled over the dead ,</l>
     <l n="67">And wrath in his heart there gathered , and a dim thought wearied his</l>

     <l n="69">And his tangled wolfish wit , that might never understand ;</l>
     <l n="70">As though some God in his dreaming had wasted the work of his hand ,</l>

     <l n="73">the bane</l>
     <l n="74">And across the throat he tore him as his very mortal foe</l>
     <l n="75">Till a cold dead corpse by the sea-strand his fosterling lay alow :</l>
     <l n="76">Then wearier yet grew Sigmund , and the dim wit seemed to pass</l>
     <l n="77">From his heart grown cold and feeble ; when lo , amid the grass</l>
     <l n="78">There came two weazles bickering , and one bit his mate by the head ,</l>
     <l n="79">Till she lay there dead before him : then he sorrowed over her dead :</l>
     <l n="80">But no long while he abode there , but into the thicket he went ,</l>
     <l n="81">And the wolfish heart of Sigmund knew somewhat his intent :</l>
     <l n="82">So he came again with a herb-leaf and laid it on his mate ,</l>
     <l n="83">And she rose up whole and living and no worser of estate</l>

     <l n="91">clad .</l>
     <l n="92">So they turn their faces homeward and a weary way they go ,</l>

     <l n="168">Then leapt those twain to their feet lest the sword and the murder fall</l>

     <l n="219">So when the first grey dawning a new day did begin ,</l>

     <l n="454">On his own then looked Sinfiotli , and great it was forsooth ,</l>
     <l n="455">But half-foundered were the horses , and a sight for all men 's ruth</l>

     <l n="461">Now Sinfiotli 's men beheld it and grew exceeding wroth ,</l>

     <l n="475">Then mad-wroth waxed King Gudrod , and he cried : “ Stand up , my men !</l>

     <l n="13">But no word answered Borghild , for her heart was grim and cold ;</l>

     <l n="40">And he drank of the wine of King-folk and thrust all care apart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">Then the second time came Borghild and stood before the twain ,</l>

     <l n="43">That my hate for thee hath perished , and the love hath sprouted green ?</l>
     <l n="44">Wilt thou thrust my gift away , and shame the hand of a queen ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So he took the cup from her fingers , and pondered over it long , And thought on the labour that should be , and the wrong that amendeth wrong .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then spake Sigmund the King : “ O son , what aileth thine heart ,</l>

     <l n="3">But he said : “ I have looked in the cup , and I see the deadly snare . ”</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Well seen it is , ” quoth Sigmund , “ but thy burden I may bear . ” And he took the beaker and drained it , and the song rose up in the hall ; And fair bethought King Sigmund his latter days befall .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But again came Borghild the Queen and stood with the cup in her hand ,</l>

     <l n="5">Then she stretched forth her fingers white ,</l>
     <l n="6">And he took the cup from her hand , nor drank , but pondered long</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">But Sigmund turned him about , and he said : “ What aileth thee , son ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">But Sinfiotli said : “ I have looked , and lo there is death in the cup . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">And the song , and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree</l>
     <l n="12">winded up :</l>
     <l n="13">And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year ;</l>
     <l n="14">And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild</l>

     <l n="16">And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees</l>
     <l n="17">waving about ;</l>
     <l n="18">So he said : “ Well seen , my fosterling ; let the lip then strain it out . ”</l>
     <l n="19">Then Sinfiotli laughed and answered : “ I drink unto Odin then ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">He drank as he spake the word , and forthwith the venom ran</l>
     <l n="22">In a chill flood over his heart , and down fell the mighty man</l>
     <l n="23">With never an uttered death-word and never a death-changed look ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the floor of the hall of the Volsungs beneath his falling shook .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="25">Then up rose the elder of days with a great and bitter cry</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="33">Then he lifted him up from the hall-floor and bore him on his breast ,</l>

     <l n="35">And his eyes were no more dreadful . Forth fared the Volsung child</l>
     <l n="36">With Signy 's son through the doorway ; and the wind was great and wild ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the moon rode high in the heavens , and whiles it shone out bright ,</l>
     <l n="38">And whiles the clouds drew over . So went he through the night ,</l>
     <l n="39">Until the dwellings of man-folk were a long while left behind .</l>
     <l n="40">Then came he unto the thicket and the houses of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="41">And the feet of the hoary mountains , and the dwellings of the deer ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the heaths without a shepherd , and the houseless dales and drear .</l>
     <l n="43">Then lo , a mighty water , a rushing flood and wide ,</l>
     <l n="44">And no ferry for the shipless ; so he went along its side ,</l>
     <l n="45">As a man that seeketh somewhat : but it widened toward the sea ,</l>

     <l n="47">But lo , in that dusk ere the dawning a glimmering over the flood ,</l>

     <l n="49">By the edge of the swirling eddy , and a white-sailed boat he saw ,</l>
     <l n="50">And its keel ran light on the strand with the last of the dying flaw .</l>
     <l n="51">But therein was a man most mighty , grey-clad like the mountain-cloud ,</l>

     <l n="1">Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son ;</l>
     <l n="3">There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done ,</l>
     <l n="4">And glad was the dawn 's awakening , and the noon-tide fair and glad :</l>
     <l n="5">There no great store had the franklin , and enough the hireling had ;</l>
     <l n="6">And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land</l>
     <l n="7">With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand .</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Twas a country of cunning craftsmen , and many a thing they wrought ,</l>
     <l n="9">That the lands of storm desired , and the homes of warfare sought .</l>
     <l n="10">But men deemed it o'erhYpppHeNwell warded by more than its stems of fight ,</l>
     <l n="11">And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might .</l>
     <l n="12">So hidden was that country , and few men sailed its sea ,</l>
     <l n="13">And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk 's company .</l>
     <l n="14">But fair-fruited , many-peopled , it lies a goodly strip ,</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood 's surging lip ,</l>
     <l n="16">And a perilous flood is its ocean , and its mountains , who shall tell</l>
     <l n="17">What things in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may</l>
     <l n="18">dwell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Now a man of the Kings , called Gripir , in this land of peace abode :</l>
     <l n="20">The son of the Helper 's father , though never lay his load</l>
     <l n="21">In the womb of the mother of Kings that the Helper 's brethren bore ;</l>
     <l n="22">But of Giant kin was his mother , of the folk that are seen no more ;</l>
     <l n="23">Though whiles as ye ride some fell-road across the heath there comes</l>
     <l n="24">The voice of their lone lamenting o'er their changed and conquered</l>
     <l n="25">homes .</l>
     <l n="26">A long way off from the sea-strand and beneath the mountains ’ feet</l>
     <l n="27">Is the high-built hall of Gripir , where the waste and the tillage meet ;</l>
     <l n="28">A noble and plentiful house , that a little men-folk fear .</l>
     <l n="29">But beloved of the crag-dwelling eagles and the kin of the woodland</l>
     <l n="30">deer .</l>
     <l n="31">A man of few words was Gripir , but he knew of all deeds that had been ,</l>
     <l n="32">And times there came upon him , when the deeds to be were seen :</l>
     <l n="33">No sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field ,</l>
     <l n="34">And against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield :</l>
     <l n="35">Yet no fear in his heart abided , nor desired he aught at all ,</l>
     <l n="36">But he noted the deeds that had been , and looked for what should</l>
     <l n="37">befall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="38">Again , in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man</l>
     <l n="39">Beardless and low of stature , of visage pinched and wan :</l>
     <l n="40">So exceeding old was Regin , that no son of man could tell</l>
     <l n="41">In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell :</l>
     <l n="42">But the youth of King Elf had he fostered , and the Helper 's youth</l>
     <l n="43">thereto ,</l>
     <l n="44">Yea and his father 's father 's : the lore of all men he knew ,</l>
     <l n="45">And was deft in every cunning , save the dealings of the sword :</l>
     <l n="46">So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned , that men trowed his every</l>
     <l n="47">word ;</l>
     <l n="48">His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight</l>
     <l n="49">With the latter days of sorrow ; all tales he told aright ;</l>
     <l n="50">The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he ;</l>
     <l n="51">And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="52">Nor might any learn him leech-craft , for before that race was made ,</l>

     <l n="58">Have the deeds of the Volsungs blossomed , and born their latest flower ;</l>
     <l n="59">In the bed there lieth a man-child , and his eyes look straight on</l>
     <l n="60">the sun ,</l>

     <l n="62">Men say of the serving-women , when they cried on the joy of the morn ,</l>

     <l n="65">And bade her be glad to behold it , how the best was sprung from the</l>
     <l n="66">best ,</l>
     <l n="67">Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child ,</l>
     <l n="68">So bright and dreadful were they ; yea though the spring morn smiled ,</l>
     <l n="69">And a thousand birds were singing round the fair familiar home ,</l>
     <l n="70">And still as on other mornings they saw folk go and come ,</l>
     <l n="71">Yet the hour seemed awful to them , and the hearts within them burned</l>
     <l n="72">As though of fateful matters their souls were newly learned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="73">But Hiordis looked on the Volsung , on her grief and her fond desire ,</l>
     <l n="74">And the hope of her heart was quickened , and her joy was a living fire ;</l>
     <l n="75">And she said : “ Now one of the earthly on the eyes of my child hath</l>
     <l n="76">gazed</l>
     <l n="77">Nor shrunk before their glory , nor stayed her love amazed :</l>
     <l n="78">I behold thee as Sigmund beholdeth ,— and I was the home of thine</l>
     <l n="79">heart —</l>
     <l n="80">Woe 's me for the day when thou wert not , and the hour when we shall</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="82">Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast</l>

     <l n="84">from the best :</l>
     <l n="85">She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand ,</l>
     <l n="86">And told him of Sigmund 's battle , and the dead by the sea-flood 's</l>
     <l n="87">strand ,</l>
     <l n="88">And of all the wars passed over , and the light with darkness blent .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So she spake , and the sun rose higher , and her speech at last was spent , And she gave him back to the women to bear forth to the people 's kings , That they too may rejoice in her glory and her day of happy things .</p>

     <l n="33">And soft the days win over , and all men his beauty bless .</l>
     <l n="34">But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed</l>
     <l n="35">To King Elf the son of the Helper , and fair their life-days sped .</l>
     <l n="36">Peace lay on the land for ever , and the fields gave good increase ,</l>
     <l n="37">And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="38">Now hath the child grown greater , and is keen and eager of wit</l>
     <l n="39">And full of understanding , and oft hath he joy to sit</l>
     <l n="40">Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech ;</l>
     <l n="41">And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each .</l>
     <l n="42">But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well ,</l>
     <l n="43">And before the Kings he cometh , and saith such words to tell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="44">“ I have fostered thy youth , King Elf , and thine O Helper of men ,</l>
     <l n="45">And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again ;</l>
     <l n="46">And now would I foster Sigurd ; for , though he be none of thy blood ,</l>
     <l n="47">Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="48">Then spake the Helper of men-folk : “ Yea , do herein thy will :</l>
     <l n="49">For thou art the Master of Masters , and hast learned me all my skill :</l>
     <l n="50">But think how bright is this youngling , and thy guile from him</l>
     <l n="51">withhold ;</l>
     <l n="52">For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold ,</l>
     <l n="53">Though three men 's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn ;</l>
     <l n="54">And I love this son of Sigmund , and mine heart to him doth yearn . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">Then Regin laughed , and answered : “ I doled out cunning to thee ;</l>
     <l n="56">But nought with him will I measure : yet no cold-heart shall he be ,</l>
     <l n="57">Nor grim , nor evil-natured : for whate'er my will might frame ,</l>

     <l n="59">And now , despite my cunning , how deem ye I shall die ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And they said he would live as he listed , and at last in peace should lie When he listed to live no longer ; so mighty and wise he was .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But again he laughed and answered : “ One day it shall come to pass ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">So is Sigurd now with Regin , and he learns him many things ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yea , all save the craft of battle , that men learned the sons of kings :</l>
     <l n="6">The smithying sword and war-coat ; the carving runes aright ;</l>
     <l n="7">The tongues of many countries , and soft speech for men 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="8">The dealing with the harp-strings , and the winding ways of song .</l>
     <l n="9">So wise of heart waxed Sigurd , and of body wondrous strong :</l>
     <l n="10">And he chased the deer of the forest , and many a wood-wolf slew ,</l>
     <l n="11">And many a bull of the mountains : and the desert dales he knew ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the heaths that the wind sweeps over ; and seaward would he fare ,</l>
     <l n="13">Far out from the outer skerries , and alone the sea-wights dare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">On a day he sat with Regin amidst the unfashioned gold ,</l>

     <l n="16">Sweet tales of the days that have been , and the Kings of the bold</l>

     <l n="18">Till the lad 's heart swelled with longing and lit his sunbright eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Then Regin looked upon him : “ Thou too shalt one day ride</l>
     <l n="20">As the Volsung Kings went faring through the noble world and wide .</l>
     <l n="21">For this land is nought and narrow , and Kings of the carles are these .</l>
     <l n="22">And their earls are acre-biders , and their hearts are dull with peace . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Sigurd knit his brows , and in wrathful wise he said : “ Ill words of those thou speakest that my youth have cherished . And the friends that have made me merry , and the land that is fair and good . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then Regin laughed and answered : “ Nay , well I see by thy mood</l>
     <l n="2">That wide wilt thou ride in the world like thy kin of the earlier days :</l>
     <l n="3">And wilt thou be wroth with thy master that he longs for thy winning</l>
     <l n="4">the praise ?</l>
     <l n="5">And now if the sooth thou sayest , that these King-folk cherish thee</l>
     <l n="6">well ,</l>
     <l n="7">Then let them give thee a gift whereof the world shall tell :</l>
     <l n="8">Yea hearken to this my counsel , and crave for a battle-steed . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Yet wroth was the lad and answered : “ I have many a horse to my need ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Then Regin answered and said : “ Thy kin of the Kings of yore</l>
     <l n="12">Were the noblest men of men-folk ; and their hearts would never rest</l>
     <l n="13">Whatso of good they had gotten , if their hands held not the best .</l>
     <l n="14">Now do thou after my counsel , and crave of thy fosterers here</l>
     <l n="15">That thou choose of the horses of Gripir whichso thine heart holds</l>
     <l n="16">dear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">He spake and his harp was with him , and he smote the strings full</l>
     <l n="18">sweet ,</l>
     <l n="19">And sang of the host of the Valkyrs , how they ride the battle to meet ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the dew from the dear manes drippeth as they ride in the first</l>
     <l n="21">of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the tree-boughs open to meet it when the wind of the dawning is</l>
     <l n="23">done :</l>
     <l n="24">And the deep dales drink its sweetness and spring into blossoming</l>
     <l n="25">grass ,</l>
     <l n="26">And the earth groweth fruitful of men , and bringeth their glory to</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="28">Then the wrath ran off from Sigurd , and he left the smithying stead</l>
     <l n="29">While the song yet rang in the doorway : and that eve to the Kings he</l>
     <l n="30">said :</l>
     <l n="31">“ Will ye do so much for mine asking as to give me a horse to my will ?</l>
     <l n="32">For belike the days shall come , that shall all my heart fulfill ,</l>
     <l n="33">And teach me the deeds of a king . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="34">Then answered King Elf and spake :</l>
     <l n="35">“ The stalls of the Kings are before thee to set aside or to take ,</l>
     <l n="36">And nought we begrudge thee the best . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Yet answered Sigurd again ;</l>
     <l n="38">For his heart of the mountains aloft and the windy drift was fain :</l>
     <l n="39">“ Fair seats for the knees of Kings ! but now do I ask for a gift</l>
     <l n="40">Such as all the world shall be praising , the best of the strong and</l>
     <l n="41">the swift</l>
     <l n="42">Ye shall give me a token for Gripir , and bid him to let me choose</l>
     <l n="43">From out of the noble stud-beasts that run in his meadow loose .</l>
     <l n="44">But if overmuch I have asked you , forget this prayer of mine ,</l>
     <l n="45">And deem the word unspoken , and get ye to the wine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="46">Then smiled King Elf , and answered : “ A long way wilt thou ride ,</l>
     <l n="47">To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide ,</l>
     <l n="48">Yea unto the death at the last : yet surely shalt thou win</l>
     <l n="49">The praise of many a people : so have thy way herein .</l>
     <l n="50">Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold</l>
     <l n="51">The sun of the early dawning , that turneth it all unto gold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="52">Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them ; and through the night he lay</l>
     <l n="53">Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way ;</l>
     <l n="54">Then he shook the sleep from off him , and that dwelling of Kings he</l>
     <l n="55">left</l>
     <l n="56">And wended his ways unto Gripir . On a crag from the mountain reft</l>
     <l n="57">Was the house of the old King builded ; and a mighty house it was ,</l>
     <l n="58">Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass :</l>
     <l n="59">But the wild ernes cried about it , and the vultures toward it flew ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber</l>
     <l n="61">through ,</l>
     <l n="62">And about were meads wide-spreading ; and many a beast thereon ,</l>
     <l n="63">Yea some that are men-folk 's terror , their sport and pasture won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">So into the hall went Sigurd ; and amidst was Gripir set</l>
     <l n="65">In a chair of the sea-beast 's tooth ; and his sweeping beard nigh met</l>
     <l n="66">The floor that was green as the ocean , and his gown was of</l>
     <l n="67">mountain-gold ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="69">Now the first of the twain spake Gripir : “ Hail King with the eyen</l>
     <l n="70">bright !</l>
     <l n="71">Nought needest thou show the token , for I know of thy life and thy</l>
     <l n="72">light .</l>
     <l n="73">And no need to tell of thy message ; it was wafted here on the wind ,</l>
     <l n="74">That thou wouldst be coming to-day a horse in my meadow to find :</l>
     <l n="75">And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that</l>
     <l n="76">shall be .</l>
     <l n="77">Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my</l>
     <l n="78">lea ,</l>
     <l n="79">And be glad as thine heart will have thee and the fate that leadeth</l>
     <l n="80">thee on ,</l>
     <l n="81">And I bid thee again come hither when the sword of worth is won ,</l>
     <l n="82">And thy loins are girt for thy going on the road that before thee lies ;</l>
     <l n="83">For a glimmering over its darkness is come before mine eyes . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="84">Then again gat Sigurd outward , and adown the steep he ran</l>
     <l n="85">And unto the horse-fed meadow : but lo , a grey-clad man ,</l>
     <l n="86">One-eyed and seeming-ancient , there met him by the way :</l>
     <l n="87">And he spake : “ Thou hastest , Sigurd ; yet tarry till I say</l>
     <l n="88">A word that shall well bestead thee : for I know of these mountains well</l>
     <l n="89">And all the lea of Gripir , and the beasts that thereon dwell . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="90">“ Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings ? art thou Gripir 's</l>
     <l n="91">horse-herd then ?</l>
     <l n="92">Nay sure , for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men</l>
     <l n="93">My master Regin tells of : and I love thy cloud-grey gown .</l>
     <l n="94">And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="95">“ Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind , ” then spake that elder of</l>
     <l n="96">days ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ And sooth do the sages say , when the beasts of my breeding they</l>
     <l n="98">praise .</l>
     <l n="99">There is one thereof in the meadow , and , wouldst thou cull him out ,</l>
     <l n="100">Thou shalt follow an elder 's counsel , who hath brought strange</l>
     <l n="101">things about ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who hath known thy father aforetime , and other kings of thy kin . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="103">So Sigurd said , “ I am ready ; and what is the deed to win ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="104">He said : “ We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side ,</l>
     <l n="105">That cometh forth from the mountains , and note what next shall betide . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="106">Then the twain sped on together , and they drave the horses on</l>
     <l n="107">Till they came to a rushing river , a water wide and wan ;</l>
     <l n="108">And the white mews hovered o'er it ; but none might hear their cry</l>
     <l n="109">For the rush and the rattle of waters , as the downlong flood swept by .</l>
     <l n="110">So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem ,</l>
     <l n="111">And many a brave steed was there ; but the flood o'ermastered them :</l>
     <l n="112">And some , it swept them down-ward , and some won back to bank ,</l>
     <l n="113">Some , caught by the net of the eddies , in the swirling hubbub sank ;</l>
     <l n="114">But one of all swam over , and they saw his mane of grey</l>
     <l n="115">Toss over the flowery meadows , a bright thing far away :</l>
     <l n="116">Wide then he wheeled about them , then took the stream again</l>
     <l n="117">And with the waves ’ white horses mingled his cloudy mane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="118">Then spake the elder of days : “ Hearken now , Sigurd , and hear ;</l>
     <l n="119">Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear ,</l>
     <l n="120">And this horse is a gift of my giving :— heed nought where thou mayst</l>
     <l n="121">ride :</l>
     <l n="122">For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide ,</l>
     <l n="123">And on earth they thought of its threshold , and the gifts I had to</l>
     <l n="124">give ;</l>
     <l n="125">Nor prayed for a little longer , and a little longer to live . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="126">Then forth he strode to the mountains , and fain was Sigurd now</l>
     <l n="127">To ask him many a matter : but dim did his bright shape grow ,</l>
     <l n="128">As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night ;</l>
     <l n="129">And the sun in the high-noon shone , and the world was exceeding bright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="130">So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand ,</l>
     <l n="131">And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland ,</l>
     <l n="132">And the youngling looks upon him , and deems none beside him good .</l>
     <l n="133">And indeed , as tells the story , he was come of Sleipnir 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="134">The tireless horse of Odin : cloud-grey he was of hue ,</l>
     <l n="135">And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund 's son he knew ,</l>
     <l n="136">So glad he went beneath him . Then the youngling 's song arose</l>
     <l n="137">As he brushed through the noon-tide blossoms of Gripir 's mighty close ,</l>
     <l n="138">Then he singeth the song of Greyfell , the horse that Odin gave ,</l>
     <l n="139">Who swam through the sweeping river , and back through the toppling</l>
     <l n="140">wave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="141">Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred , and of the Gold that was</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="143">Now yet the days pass over , and more than words may tell</l>
     <l n="144">Grows Sigurd strong and lovely , and all children love him well .</l>
     <l n="145">But oft he looks on the mountains and many a time is fain</l>
     <l n="146">To know of what lies beyond them , and learn of the wide world 's gain .</l>
     <l n="147">And he saith : “ I dwell in a land that is ruled by none of my blood ;</l>
     <l n="148">And my mother 's sons are waxing , and fair kings shall they be and good ;</l>
     <l n="149">And their servant or their betrayer — not one of these will I be .</l>
     <l n="150">Yet needs must I wait for a little till Odin calls for me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="151">Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin 's hall</l>
     <l n="152">And hearkened many tidings of what had chanced to fall ,</l>
     <l n="153">And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild ,</l>
     <l n="154">And at last saith the crafty master :</l>
     <l n="155">“ Thou art King Sigmund 's child :</l>
     <l n="156">Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little</l>
     <l n="157">land ,</l>
     <l n="158">Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand ;</l>
     <l n="159">Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about ,</l>
     <l n="160">When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods ’</l>
     <l n="161">shout ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="162">Then Sigurd answered and said : “ Nought such do I look to be .</l>
     <l n="163">But thou , a deedless man , too much thou eggest me :</l>
     <l n="164">And these folk are good and trusty , and the land is lovely and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="165">And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin 's feet :</l>
     <l n="166">Yet I know that the world is wide , and filled with deeds unwrought ;</l>
     <l n="167">And for e'en such work was I fashioned , lest the songcraft come to</l>
     <l n="168">nought ,</l>
     <l n="169">When the harps of God-home tinkle , and the Gods are at stretch to</l>

     <l n="173">When the bonds of the Wolf wax thin , and Loki fretteth his chain .</l>
     <l n="174">And sure for the house of my fathers full oft my heart is fain ,</l>
     <l n="175">And meseemeth I hear them talking of the day when I shall come ,</l>
     <l n="176">And of all the burden of deeds , that my hand shall bear them home .</l>
     <l n="177">And so when the deed is ready , nowise the man shall lack :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="179">Then answered Regin the guileful : “ The deed is ready to hand ,</l>
     <l n="180">Yet holding my peace is the best , for well thou lovest the land ;</l>

     <l n="182">And why should the full-fed feaster his hand to the rye-bread raise ?</l>
     <l n="183">Yet they say that Sigmund begat thee and he looked to fashion a man .</l>
     <l n="184">Fear nought ; he lieth quiet in his mound by the sea-waves wan . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="185">So shone the eyes of Sigurd , that the shield against him hung</l>

     <l n="187">rung :</l>
     <l n="188">“ Tell me , thou Master of Masters , what deed is the deed I shall do ?</l>
     <l n="189">Nor mock thou the son of Sigmund lest the day of his birth thou rue . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="190">Then answered the Master of Sleight : “ The deed is the righting of</l>

     <l n="165">And he hearkens Greyfell 's going as he wends adown the lea ,</l>
     <l n="166">And his heart for love is craving , and the deeds he deems shall be ;</l>
     <l n="167">And he hears the Wrath 's sheath tinkling as he rides the daisies down</l>
     <l n="168">And he thinks of his love laid safely in the arms of his renown .</l>
     <l n="169">But lo , as he rides the meadows , before him now he sees</l>

     <l n="181">sought ,</l>
     <l n="182">But flew up to a high-built tower , and sat in the window a space ,</l>

     <l n="192">For full lovely was it fashioned , and great was the pillared hall ,</l>
     <l n="193">And fair in its hangings were woven the deeds that Kings befall ,</l>
     <l n="194">And the merry sun went through it and gleamed in gold and horn ;</l>
     <l n="195">But afield or a-fell are its carles , and none labour there that morn ,</l>

     <l n="542">There he wonders at their life-days and their fond imaginings ,</l>

     <l n="116">Wide then he wheeled with Gunnar , but with hand and knee he dealt ,</l>
     <l n="117">And the voice of a lord belovèd , till the steed his master felt ,</l>
     <l n="118">And bore him back to the brethren ; by Greyfell Sigurd stood ,</l>
     <l n="119">And stared at the heart of the fire , and his helm was red as blood ;</l>

     <l n="125">Let Sigurd lend thee his steed that wore the Glittering Heath ,</l>
     <l n="126">And carried the Bed of the Serpent , and the ancient ruddy rings .</l>
     <l n="127">So perchance may the mocks be lesser when men tell of the Niblung</l>

     <l n="129">Then Sigurd looked on the twain , and he saw their swart hair wave</l>

     <l n="132">But at last he spake : “ O brother , on Greyfell shalt thou ride ,</l>
     <l n="133">And do on the Helm of Aweing and gird the Wrath to thy side ,</l>
     <l n="134">And cover thy breast with the war-coat that is throughly woven of gold ,</l>
     <l n="135">That hath not its like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told :</l>
     <l n="136">For this is the raiment of Kings when they ride the Flickering Fire ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="138">Then Hogni laughed in his heart , and he said : “ This changing were well</l>

     <l n="141">Thou shalt take the war-steed , Gunnar , and enough or nought it shall</l>

     <l n="144">Then Sigurd looked on the speaker , as one who would answer again ,</l>

     <l n="146">Then he casteth the reins to his brother , and Gunnar praiseth his gift ,</l>

   <p>“ Thou art come , O King of the Niblungs ; what mighty deed is to frame That thou wearest the cloudy harness , and the arms of the Niblung name ? ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He spake : “ O woman , thou mockest ! what King of the people is here ?</l>

     <l n="4">Nay , the hunt is up in the world and the Gods to the forest will wend ,</l>

     <l n="8">To cry out in the face of their brightness and mar their glad renown ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She heeded him not , nor hearkened : but he said : “ Thou wert wise of old ; And hither I come at thy bidding : let the thought of thine heart be told . ”</p>

     <l n="1">She said : “ What aileth thee , Gunnar ? time was thou wert great and glad .</l>

     <l n="3">She turned and departed from him , and he knew not whither she went ;</l>

     <l n="16">And Grimhild spake as it clattered : “ For whom are the peace-strings</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">Then spake Hogni and answered : “ All lands beneath the sun</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Speak , brother of Kings , ” said Gunnar , “ dost thou know deeds better or worse That shall wash us clean from shaming , and redeem our lives from the curse ? ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Again spake Grimhild the wise-wife : “ Where then is Guttorm the brave ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Then Hogni laughed and answered : “ His feet on the threshold stand :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">Then in through the door strode Guttorm fair-clad in hunter 's guise ,</l>
     <l n="22">With no steel save his wood-knife girded ; but his war-fain eyes stared</l>
     <l n="23">wild ,</l>
     <l n="24">As he spake : “ What words are ye hiding from the youngest Niblung child ?</l>
     <l n="25">What work is to win , my brethren , that ye sit in warrior 's weed ,</l>
     <l n="26">And tell me nought of the glory , and cover up the deed ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="27">Then uprose Grimhild the wise-wife , and took the cup again ;</l>
     <l n="28">Night-long had she brewed that witch-drink and laboured not in vain ,</l>
     <l n="29">For therein was the creeping venom , and hearts of things that prey</l>
     <l n="30">On the hidden lives of ocean , and never look on day ;</l>
     <l n="31">And the heart of the ravening wood-wolf and the hunger-blinded beast</l>
     <l n="32">And the spent slaked heart of the wild-fire the guileful cup increased :</l>
     <l n="33">But huge words of ancient evil about its rim were scored ,</l>
     <l n="34">The curse and the eyeless craving of the first that fashioned sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="35">So the cup in her hand was gleaming , as she turned unto Guttorm and</l>

     <l n="40">That thy name may be set in glory and thy deeds live on in light . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Forth flashed the flame from his eyen , and he cried : “ Where then is the foe , This dread of mine house and my brethren , that my hand may lay him alow ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Drink , son , ” she said , “ and be merry ! and I shall tell his name , Whose death shall crown thy life-days , and increase thy fame with his fame . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He drinketh and craveth for battle , and his hand for a sword doth seek ,</l>
     <l n="2">And he looketh about on his brethren , but his lips no word may speak ;</l>
     <l n="3">They speak the name , and he hears not , and again he drinks of the cup</l>
     <l n="4">And knows not friend nor kindred , and the wrath in his heart wells up ,</l>
     <l n="5">That no God may bear unmingled , and he cries a wordless cry ,</l>
     <l n="6">As the last of the day is departing and the dusk time drawing anigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Then Grimhild goes from the chamber , and bringeth his harness of war ,</l>
     <l n="8">And therewith they array his body , and he drinketh the cup once more ,</l>
     <l n="9">And his heart is set on the murder , and now may he understand</l>
     <l n="10">What soul is dight for the slaying , and what quarry is for his hand .</l>
     <l n="11">For again , they tell him of Sigurd , and the man he remembereth ,</l>
     <l n="12">And praiseth his mighty name and his deeds that laughed on death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Now dusk and dark draw over , and through the glimmering house</l>

     <l n="17">In their thrones sit Gunnar and Hogni , but Guttorm stands on the floor</l>
     <l n="18">With his blue blade naked before them : the torches flare from the wall</l>
     <l n="19">And the woven God-folk waver , but the hush is deep in the hall ,</l>
     <l n="20">And those Niblung faces change not , though the slow moon slips from her</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">Now it was in the earliest dawn-dusk that Guttorm stirred in his place ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the mail-rings tinkled upon him , as he turned his helm-hid face ,</l>
     <l n="25">And went forth from the hall and the high-seat ; but the Kings sat still</l>
     <l n="26">in their pride</l>
     <l n="27">And hearkened the clash of his going and heeded how it died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="28">Slow , all alone goeth Guttorm to Sigurd 's chamber door ,</l>
     <l n="29">And all is open before him , and the white moon lies on the floor</l>
     <l n="30">And the bed where Sigurd lieth with Gudrun on his breast ,</l>
     <l n="31">And light comes her breath from her bosom in the joy of infinite rest .</l>
     <l n="32">Then Guttorm stands on the threshold , and his heart of the murder is</l>
     <l n="33">fain ,</l>
     <l n="34">And he thinks of the deeds of Sigurd , and praiseth his greatness and</l>
     <l n="35">gain ;</l>
     <l n="36">Bright blue is his blade in the moonlight — but lo , how Sigurd lies ,</l>
     <l n="37">As the carven dead that die not , with fair wide-open eyes ;</l>
     <l n="38">And their glory gleameth on Guttorm , and the hate in his heart is</l>
     <l n="39">chilled ,</l>

     <l n="45">Then they see where cometh Guttorm , but they cast him never a word ,</l>
     <l n="46">For white ‘ neath the flickering torches they see his unstained sword ;</l>
     <l n="47">But he gazed on those Kings of the kindred , and the beast of war awoke ;</l>
     <l n="48">And his heart was exceeding wrathful with the tarrying of the stroke :</l>
     <l n="49">And he strode to the chamber of Sigurd , and again they heeded well</l>
     <l n="50">How the clash , in the cloister awakened , by the threshold died and</l>

     <l n="52">But Guttorm gazed from the threshold , and the moon was fading away</l>

     <l n="54">On the bosom of the Volsung , and her hand lay light on her lord ;</l>
     <l n="55">But dread were his eyes wide-open , and they gleamed against the sword ,</l>
     <l n="56">And Guttorm shrank from before them , and back to the hall he came :</l>
     <l n="57">There the biding brethren behold him flash wild in the torches ’ flame ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nor stir their lips to question ; but their swords on their knees are</l>
     <l n="59">laid ;</l>
     <l n="60">The torches faint in the dawning , and they see his unstained blade .</l>

     <l n="61">Now dieth moon and candle , and though the day be nigh</l>

     <l n="64">stir :</l>
     <l n="65">Then the brethren hist and hearken , for a sound of feet they hear ,</l>
     <l n="66">And into the hall of the Niblungs a white thing cometh apace :</l>
     <l n="67">But the sword of Guttorm upriseth , and he wendeth from his place ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the clash of steel goes with him ; yet loud as it may sound</l>
     <l n="69">Still more they hear those footsteps light-falling on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="70">And the hearts of the Niblungs waver , and their pride is smitten acold ,</l>
     <l n="71">For they look on that latest comer , and Brynhild they behold :</l>
     <l n="72">But she sits by their side in silence , and heeds them nothing more</l>

     <l n="76">There the moon from the floor hath departed and heaven without is grey ,</l>
     <l n="77">And afar in the eastern quarter faint glimmer streaks of day .</l>
     <l n="78">Close over the head of Sigurd the Wrath gleams wan and bare ,</l>

     <l n="90">Woe 's me ! how the house of the Niblungs by another cry was rent ,</l>

     <l n="12">And the wind of that summer morning through the Eastland banners ran :</l>

     <l n="20">And shook the ancient timbers , and the carven work of the hall :</l>
     <l n="21">Then it was to the Niblung warriors as their very hearts they heard</l>
     <l n="22">Cry out , not glad nor sorry , nor hoping , nor afeard ,</l>

     <l n="35">Of the Battle in Atli 's Hall .</l>

     <l n="36">Ye shall know that in Atli 's feast-hall on the side that joined the</l>
     <l n="37">house</l>
     <l n="38">Were many carven doorways whose work was glorious</l>
     <l n="39">With marble stones and gold-work , and their doors of beaten brass :</l>
     <l n="40">Lo now , in the merry morning how the story cometh to pass !</l>
     <l n="41">— While the echoes of the trumpet yet fill the people 's ears ,</l>
     <l n="42">And Hogni casts by the war-horn , and his Dwarf-wrought sword uprears ,</l>
     <l n="43">All those doors aforesaid open , and in pour the streams of steel ,</l>
     <l n="44">The best of the Eastland champions , the bold men of Atli 's weal :</l>
     <l n="45">They raise no cry of battle nor cast forth threat of woe ,</l>
     <l n="46">And their helmed and hidden faces from each other none may know :</l>
     <l n="47">Then a light in the hall ariseth , and the fire of battle runs</l>
     <l n="48">All adown the front of the Niblungs in the face of the mighty-ones ;</l>
     <l n="49">All eyes are set upon them , hard drawn is every breath ,</l>
     <l n="50">Ere the foremost points be mingled and death be blent with death .</l>
     <l n="51">— All eyes save the eyes of Hogni ; but e'en as the edges meet ,</l>
     <l n="52">He turneth about for a moment to the gold of the kingly seat ,</l>
     <l n="53">Then aback to the front of battle ; there then , as the lightning-flash</l>
     <l n="54">Through the dark night showeth the city when the clouds of heaven</l>
     <l n="55">clash ,</l>
     <l n="56">And the gazer shrinketh backward , yet he seeth from end to end</l>
     <l n="57">The street and the merry market , and the windows of his friend ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the pavement where his footsteps yestre'en returning trod ,</l>
     <l n="59">Now white and changed and dreadful ‘ neath the threatening voice of God ;</l>
     <l n="60">So Hogni seeth Gudrun , and the face he used to know ,</l>
     <l n="61">Unspeakable , unchanging , with white unknitted brow ,</l>
     <l n="62">With half-closed lips untrembling , with deedless hands and cold</l>
     <l n="63">Laid still on knees that stir not , and the linen 's moveless fold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="64">Turned Hogni unto the spear-wall , and smote from where he stood ,</l>
     <l n="65">And hewed with his sword two-handed as the axe-man in a wood :</l>
     <l n="66">Before his sword was a champion and the edges clave to the chin ,</l>
     <l n="67">And the first man fell in the feast-hall of those that should fall</l>
     <l n="68">therein ,</l>
     <l n="69">Then man with man was dealing , and the Niblung host of war</l>
     <l n="70">Was swept by the leaping iron , as the rock anigh the shore</l>
     <l n="71">By the ice-cold waves of winter : yet a moment Gunnar stayed ,</l>
     <l n="72">As high in his hand unbloodied he shook his awful blade ;</l>
     <l n="73">And he cried :</l>
     <l n="74">“ O Eastland champions , do ye behold it here ,</l>
     <l n="75">The sword of the ancient Giuki ? Fall on and have no fear ,</l>
     <l n="76">But slay and be slain and be famous , if your master 's will it be !</l>
     <l n="77">Yet are we the blameless Niblungs , and bidden guests are we :</l>
     <l n="78">So forbear , if ye wander hood-winked , nor for nothing slay and be</l>
     <l n="79">slain ;</l>
     <l n="80">For I know not what to tell you of the dead that live again . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="81">So he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war-flame reared on</l>
     <l n="82">high ,</l>
     <l n="83">But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry</l>
     <l n="84">From the iron men of Atli , and the bickering of the steel</l>
     <l n="85">Sends a roar up to the roof-ridge , and the Niblung war-ranks reel</l>
     <l n="86">Behind the steadfast Gunnar : but lo , have ye seen the corn ,</l>
     <l n="87">While yet men grind the sickle , by the wind-streak overborne</l>
     <l n="88">When the sudden rain sweeps downward , and summer groweth black ,</l>
     <l n="89">And the smitten wood-side roareth ‘ neath the driving thunder-wrack ?</l>
     <l n="90">So before the wise-heart Hogni shrank the champions of the East</l>
     <l n="91">As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of Atli 's feast .</l>
     <l n="92">There he smote and beheld not the smitten , and by nought were his</l>
     <l n="93">edges stopped ;</l>
     <l n="94">He smote and the dead were thrust from him ; a hand with its shield he</l>
     <l n="95">lopped ;</l>
     <l n="96">There met him Atli 's marshal , and his arm at the shoulder he shred ;</l>
     <l n="97">Three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the</l>
     <l n="98">dead ;</l>
     <l n="99">And he struck off a head to the rightward , and his sword through a</l>
     <l n="100">throat he thrust ,</l>
     <l n="101">But the third stroke fell on his helm-crest , and he stooped to the</l>
     <l n="102">ruddy dust ,</l>
     <l n="103">And uprose as the ancient Giant , and both his hands were wet :</l>
     <l n="104">Red then was the world to his eyen , as his hand to the labour he set ;</l>
     <l n="105">Swords shook and fell in his pathway , huge bodies leapt and fell ,</l>
     <l n="106">Harsh grided shield and war-helm like the tempest-smitten bell ,</l>
     <l n="107">And the war-cries ran together , and no man his brother knew ,</l>
     <l n="108">And the dead men loaded the living , as he went the war-wood through ;</l>
     <l n="109">And man ‘ gainst man was huddled , till no sword rose to smite .</l>
     <l n="110">And clear stood the glorious Hogni in an island of the fight ,</l>
     <l n="111">And there ran a river of death ‘ twixt the Niblung and his foes ,</l>
     <l n="112">And therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the Gods arose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="113">Now fell the sword of Gunnar and rose up red in the air ,</l>
     <l n="114">And hearkened the song of the Niblung , as his voice rang glad and</l>
     <l n="115">clear ,</l>
     <l n="116">And rejoiced and leapt at the Eastmen , and cried as it met the rings</l>
     <l n="117">Of a giant of King Atli , and a murder-wolf of kings ;</l>
     <l n="118">But it quenched its thirst in his entrails , and knew the heart in his</l>
     <l n="119">breast ,</l>
     <l n="120">And hearkened the praise of Gunnar , and lingered not to rest ,</l>
     <l n="121">But fell upon Atli 's brother and stayed not in his brain ;</l>
     <l n="122">Then he fell and the King leapt over , and clave a neck atwain ,</l>
     <l n="123">And leapt o'er the sweep of a pole-axe and thrust a lord in the throat ,</l>
     <l n="124">And King Atli 's banner-bearer through shield and hauberk smote ;</l>
     <l n="125">Then he laughed on the huddled East-folk , and against their</l>
     <l n="126">war-shields drave</l>
     <l n="127">While the white swords tossed about him , and that archer 's skull he</l>
     <l n="128">clave</l>
     <l n="129">Whom Atli had bought in the Southlands for many a pound of gold ;</l>
     <l n="130">And the dark-skinned fell upon Gunnar and over his war-shield rolled</l>
     <l n="131">And cumbered his sword for a season , and the many blades fell on ,</l>
     <l n="132">And sheared the cloudy helm-crest and rents in his hauberk won ,</l>
     <l n="133">And the red blood ran from Gunnar ; till that Giuki 's sword outburst ,</l>
     <l n="134">As the fire-tongue from the smoulder that the leafy heap hath nursed ,</l>
     <l n="135">And unshielded smote King Gunnar , and sent the Niblung song</l>
     <l n="136">Through the quaking stems of battle in the hall of Atli 's wrong :</l>
     <l n="137">Then he rent the knitted war-hedge till by Hogni 's side he stood ,</l>
     <l n="138">And kissed him amidst of the spear-hail , and their cheeks were wet</l>
     <l n="139">with blood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="140">Then on came the Niblung bucklers , and they drave the East-folk home</l>
     <l n="141">As the bows of the oar-driven long-ship beat off the waves in foam :</l>
     <l n="142">They leave their dead behind them , and they come to the doors and the</l>

     <l n="144">And a few last spears from the fleeing amidst their shield-hedge fall :</l>
     <l n="145">But the doors clash to in their faces , as the fleeing rout they drive ,</l>
     <l n="146">And fain would follow after ; and none is left alive</l>
     <l n="147">In the feast-hall of King Atli , save those fishes of the net ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="149">Then biddeth the heart-wise Hogni , and men to the windows climb ,</l>

     <l n="153">For the spears and shields of the Eastlands that the merchant city</l>
     <l n="154">throng :</l>
     <l n="155">And back to the Niblung burg-gate the way seemed weary-long .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="156">Yet passeth hour on hour , and the doors they watch and ward ,</l>

     <l n="228">Now the noon was long passed over when again the rumour arose ,</l>
     <l n="229">And through the doors cast open flowed in the river of foes :</l>
     <l n="230">They flooded the hall of the murder , and surged round that rampart of</l>

     <l n="232">No war-duke ran before them , no lord to the onset led ,</l>

     <l n="235">Till the misty hall was blinded with the bitter drift of war :</l>
     <l n="236">Few and faint were the Niblung children , and their wounds were waxen</l>

     <l n="253">And saw not what was before them ; as in the dark men smote ,</l>
     <l n="254">Men died heart-broken , unsmitten ; men wept with the cry in the throat ,</l>

     <l n="263">Loud rose the roar of the East-folk , and the end was coming at last ;</l>

     <l n="30">So they led the Niblung away from the light and the joy of the feast ,</l>

     <l n="614">When I woke and looked on Sigurd , and he rose on the world and shone !</l>

     <l n="618">But the fire roared up against him , and the smoke-cloud rolled aloof ,</l>
     <l n="619">And back and down from the timbers , and the carven work of the roof ;</l>
     <l n="620">There the ancient trees were crackling as the red flames shot aloft</l>

     <l n="623">The gold and the sea-born purple , shrank up in a moment of space ,</l>

     <l n="628">they heard ,</l>

     <l n="630">smitten with dread ,</l>
     <l n="631">And they deemed that their house was fallen to the innermost place of</l>
     <l n="632">the dead ,</l>
     <l n="633">The hall for the traitors builded , the house of the changeless plain ;</l>

     <l n="636">They rushed , and came nowhither ; each man beheld his foe ,</l>
     <l n="637">And smote as the hopeless and dying , nor brother brother might know ,</l>
     <l n="638">The sons of one mother 's sorrow in the fire-blast strove and smote ,</l>
     <l n="639">And the sword of the first-begotten was thrust in the father 's throat ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="80">
     <l n="643">There Gudrun stood o'er the turmoil ; there stood the Niblung child ;</l>
     <l n="644">As the battle-horn is dreadful , as the winter wind is wild ,</l>
     <l n="645">So dread and shrill was her crying and the cry none heeded or heard ,</l>
