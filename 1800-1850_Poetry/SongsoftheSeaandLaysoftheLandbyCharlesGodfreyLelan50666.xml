    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Among the songs in this collection are the Brand New Ballads already known more or less to the public , several of them having an American newspaper circulation , while a few are given at times in public readings ; since I have learned , for example , that “ In Nevada ” was one of the stock-pieces of Mr. Clifford Harrison . They now reappear amended and with additions .</p>
    <p n="2">In the “ Songs of the Sea ” the reader will not fail to observe that three or four , such as the “ Mermaid ” and “ Time for Us to Go ,” are not by me at all . They are sailors ’ songs of the olden time , introduced as suggestions for other lyrics , as I have indeed declared in the text , and also to aid in the main purpose or idea which inspires the whole collection — they being in this respect like stones from more ancient edifices built into new houses , as was the wont of men in the middle age .</p>
    <p n="3">This main purpose was to set forth with scrupulous care , as of a statue photographed from many sides , the mariner of the sailing — not steaming — ship , who is now rapidly passing away , although some tens of thousands of the species are still to be found in the remoter routes of travel . This kind of man should be interesting , because he is almost the only one who is drawn into his calling by a desire to rove about the world and lead an adventurous , reckless , manly life . Into this life entered , I may say , as “ vitalising elements ,” “ shipwrecks and disasters of the sea ,” the extremes of discipline and dissipation , as well as those of cynical scepticism and superstition , the seeing , like Ulysses , cities and men , and the consciousness , so clear to undeveloped minds and smaller natures , of belonging to a “ peculiar ” class . This I have borne in mind most earnestly , and those who perceive it will also find that in this spirit the following notes and sketches in song illustrate , I trust accurately , a consistent ideal text , and that all the songs unite to form a single poem .</p>
    <p n="4">As for the many scraps , “ chanties ,” choruses , sayings , similes , and bits of sea-lore worked up into the lyrics here and there , I make no attempt whatever to indicate what is borrowed ; all that I can say of it is , that if the mere gathering the stones is all the merit of making a mosaic picture ( as many seem to think ) , then I could claim little merit for originality . But as this is not a folk-lore book , in which a writer is held sternly accountable “ to give authority for every word ,” and as a mass of notes would have simply defeated the whole aim of the book , I have preferred making myself amenable to the charge of plagiarism to boring my reader — even as an Italian devoted servant of whom I once heard , preferred to be carried off by the police , on the charge of stealing oranges , rather than awaken and disturb his master who could have explained the matter . I can , however , truly say that as regards ideas , incidents , tales , turns of speech and idioms , current sayings , and so on , from poetry down to vulgarity , I have literally taken so much from sailors themselves that the work , if analysed , would be a curiosity of collocation , like the poems made up entirely of proverbs , or the Sermon of Texts .</p>
    <p n="5">Here I would mention my obligation to more than one ancient mariner , and specially to my old friend , Captain Stead , now so long a dweller at the Langham Hotel , for advising about , and revising , these ballads . These friends having carefully studied the work and corrected or modelled its every sentence into ship-shape , have been kind enough to assure me that it would hold its own in the forecastle , as a real thing , and not an imitation ; which saying uttered in sooth and truth especially by a friend of forty years ’ experience in sailing-vessels , mostly “ before the war ,” was to me greatly encouraging .</p>
    <p n="6">What I have above written of the “ Songs of the Sea ” is equally true of the other ballads in this volume . They also form a series of eccentric pictures of American life after the war , brought together , not like chance pictures in a scrap-book , but as I before said , to carry out one idea in reference to a special subject . In this spirit and to this end were they written , from current prose tales . Nor have I ever forgotten that there is in them for the future a kind of folk-lore which is never so apparent to those who live in it as to those who inherit it . When I was a small boy , there was in my aunt ’ s kitchen in Milford , Massachusetts , a cheese-knife , which had no special interest to anybody save to me , because it had been the very sword carried by General Eaton in his famous march over the Desert to attack Algiers . Nowadays it would be greatly prized . So it is sometimes worth while to think of these things which we now possess , and how rapidly they are hastening to become curiosities — I myself having lived to see every object familiar to me in youth become bric-à-brac . In the last age , everything not in the newest fashion was despised — in this there is a highly-cultured class just beginning to show itself beyond the Realists and disciples of Mental-analytical Chemistry , who look alternately at the Past and Future ,</p>
    <p n="7">Even as Janus on the Capitol Saw all that was or ever yet would be .</p>
    <p n="8">There may be a few among the jealous guardians or spokes around the Hub who may demand by what right I invade the sacred precincts of Boston , and sing about its past . Well , my boyhood was half passed in Boston or near it ; there the romance of sailor life , which was marvellous in those times , imbued me , and then and there in common with my mates I devoured the Mariners ’ Chronicle , Shipwrecks and Disasters of the Sea , Lives of the Buccaneers , and listened with avidity to the tales of those who had been on the briny deep . Nearly all my first-cousins had at one time or other run away and gone to sea or taken long voyages . Among the former were Benjamin Stimson , the “ S ” of Two Years Before the Mast ; Charles Leland , who afterwards grew like Samuel Jackson to the height of seven feet ; and Samuel Godfrey . From these and many more I learned an incredible number of sea stories and songs , none of which I ever forgot , being to an extraordinary degree accustomed to keep repeating to myself these “ stranger legends of the olden time .” Hence it comes that I have in my mind such vivid memories of the old North End of Boston .</p>
    <p n="9">I would say in conclusion what will be apparent enough to many , that these Ballads make no great pretence to be poetry . They consist of incidents or small “ motives ” cast into rhyme or measure , as the easiest method of giving them a certain value , just as a tune brings out a song . Most rhymers are criticised more or less severely for pretending to be poets ; all that I can claim for this volume is , that it is a kind of collection of curiosities which , as they have seemed to me to be worth remembering , will , I trust , be regarded by others as worth reading .</p>

    <p>THE OLD TAVERN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">In the North End of Boston , long ago ;</l>
     <l n="9">Although ’ tis yet within my memory ;</l>
     <l n="10">There were of gabled houses many a row ,</l>
     <l n="11">With overhanging storeys two or three ,</l>
     <l n="12">And many with half-doors over whose end</l>
     <l n="13">Leaning upon her elbows , the good-wife</l>
     <l n="14">At eventide conversed with many a friend</l>
     <l n="15">Of all the little chances of their life ;</l>
     <l n="16">Small ripples in a stream which ran full slow</l>
     <l n="17">In the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">And ’ mid these houses was a Hostelrie</l>
     <l n="19">Frequented by the people of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Known as the Boy and Barrel , from its sign :</l>
     <l n="21">A jolly urchin on a cask of wine</l>
     <l n="22">Bearing the words which puzzled every eye —</l>
     <l n="23">Orbus In Tactu Mainet<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Heaven knows why .</l>
     <l n="24">Even there a bit of Latin made a show ,</l>
     <l n="25">In the North End of Boston — long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="26">And many a sailor , when his cruise was o ’ er ,</l>
     <l n="27">Bore straight for it soon as he touched the shore :</l>
     <l n="28">In many a stormy night upon the sea</l>
     <l n="29">He ’ d thought upon the Boy — and of the spree</l>
     <l n="30">He ’ d have when there , and let all trouble go ,</l>
     <l n="31">In the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="32">There , like their vessels in a friendly port ,</l>
     <l n="33">Met many mariners of every kind ,</l>
     <l n="34">Spinning strange yarns of many a varied sort ,</l>
     <l n="35">Well sheltered from the ocean and the wind ;</l>
     <l n="36">In a long low dark room they lounged at ease ;</l>
     <l n="37">Strange men there were from many a distant land ,</l>
     <l n="38">And there above the high old chimney-piece</l>
     <l n="39">Were curiosities from many a strand ,</l>
     <l n="40">Which often made strange tales and memories flow</l>
     <l n="41">In the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="42">And there I often sat to hear those tales ,</l>
     <l n="43">From men who ’ d passed through storm and fight and fire ,</l>
     <l n="44">Of mighty icebergs and stupendous whales ,</l>
     <l n="45">Of shipwrecked crews and of adventures dire ,</l>
     <l n="46">Until the thought came to me on a time ,</l>
     <l n="47">While I was listening to that merry throng ,</l>
     <l n="48">That I would write their stories out in rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="49">And weave into it many a sailor ’ s song ,</l>
     <l n="50">That men might something of the legends know</l>
     <l n="51">Of the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="52">First it was said that Captain Kidd in truth</l>
     <l n="53">Had revelled in that tavern with his crew ,</l>
     <l n="54">And there it was he lost the Golden Tooth</l>
     <l n="55">Which brought him treasure , and the gossips knew</l>
     <l n="56">Moll Pitcher dwelt there in the days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="57">And Peter Rugg had stopped before the door :</l>
     <l n="58">Tom Walker there did with the Devil go</l>
     <l n="59">In the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="60">Nor had I long to wait , for at the word</l>
     <l n="61">Some one observed that he had seen in Spain</l>
     <l n="62">A captain hung — which Abner Chapin heard</l>
     <l n="63">And said , “ I too upon the Spanish Main</l>
     <l n="64">Met with a man well known unto us all ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who nearly hung a Captain General .”</l>
     <l n="66">He told the tale and I did rhyme it so ;</l>
     <l n="67">In the North End of Boston , long ago .</l>

    </lg>
    <p>EL CAPITAN GENERAL</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="70">There was a Captain General who ruled in Vera Cruz ,</l>
     <l n="71">And what we used to hear of him was always evil news ;</l>
     <l n="72">He was a pirate on the sea — a robber on the shore :</l>
     <l n="73">The Señor Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="74">There was a Yankee skipper who round about did roam ,</l>
     <l n="75">His name was Stephen Folger and Nantucket was his home ,</l>
     <l n="76">And having gone to Vera Cruz he had been skinned full sore</l>
     <l n="77">By the Señor Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="78">But having got away alive , though all his cash was gone ,</l>
     <l n="79">He said , “ If there is Vengeance , I will surely try it on !</l>
     <l n="80">And I do wish I may be damned if I don ’ t clear the score</l>
     <l n="81">With Señor Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador !”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="82">He shipped a crew of seventy men — well-arméd men were they ,</l>
     <l n="83">And sixty of them in the hold he darkly stowed away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And sailing back to Vera Cruz was sighted from the shore ,</l>
     <l n="85">By the Señor Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="86">With twenty-five soldados he came on board so pleased</l>
     <l n="87">And said : “ Maldito Yankee — again your ship is seized .</l>
     <l n="88">How many sailors have you got ?” Said Folger , “ Ten — no more ,”</l>
     <l n="89">To the Captain Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="90">“ But come into my cabin and take a glass of wine ,</l>
     <l n="91">I do suppose as usual , I ’ ll have to pay a fine ;</l>
     <l n="92">I have got some old Madeira and we ’ ll talk the matter o ’ er —</l>
     <l n="93">My Capitan Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="94">And as over that Madeira the Captain General boozed ,</l>
     <l n="95">It seemed to him as if his head was getting quite confused ,</l>
     <l n="96">For it happened that some morphine had travelled from “ the store ”</l>
     <l n="97">To the glass of Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="98">“ What is it makes the vessel roll ? What sounds are these I hear ?</l>
     <l n="99">It seems as if the rising waves were beating on my ear !”</l>
     <l n="100">“ Oh it is the breaking of the surf — just that and nothing more ,</l>
     <l n="101">My Captain Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador !”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="102">The Governor was in a sleep which muddled all his brains ,</l>
     <l n="103">The seventy men had got his gang and put them all in chains ,</l>
     <l n="104">And when he woke the following day he could not see the shore ,</l>
     <l n="105">For he was out on the blue water — the Don San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="106">“ Now do you see that yard-arm — and understand the thing ?”</l>
     <l n="107">Said Captain Folger , “ For all from that yard-arm you shall swing ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or forty thousand dollars you must pay me from your store ,</l>
     <l n="109">My Captain Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="110">The Capitano took a pen — the order he did sign ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ O Señor Yankee !— but you charge amazing high for wine !”</l>
     <l n="112">But ’ twas not till the draft was paid they let him go ashore ,</l>
     <l n="113">El Señor Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="114">The greatest sharp some day will find another sharper wit ,</l>
     <l n="115">It always makes the devil laugh to see a biter bit ;</l>
     <l n="116">It takes two Spaniards any day to come a Yankee o ’ er :</l>
     <l n="117">Even two like Don Alonzo Estabán San Salvador .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="118">And when this tale was told , another man</l>
     <l n="119">Cried out , “ I ’ ll swear ’ tis true as true can be ,</l>
     <l n="120">Unto his health we ’ ll have all round a can !</l>
     <l n="121">For Captain Folger is well known to me .</l>
     <l n="122">Now I will sing ‘ first lines ’ of ‘ Uncle Sam ,’</l>
     <l n="123">And he who can shall add at once a second ,</l>
     <l n="124">I ’ ll call you one by one — now here I am ,</l>
     <l n="125">And he who balks shall be the loser reckoned ,</l>
     <l n="126">And pay for drinks all round ”—</l>
     <l n="127">“ All right ,” they roared ,</l>
     <l n="128">“ Now then begin , for we are all on board !”</l>
    </lg>
    <p>UNCLE SAM</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="129">When there ’ s rain and shine together ,</l>

     <l n="15">For fear of fatal accidents — not knowin ’ what might come ,</l>

     <l n="20">And likewise , in religion , they were awful jolly green .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">But they had a dim tradition , from their ancestors , in course ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which they had somehow derived from a very ancient source :</l>
     <l n="23">How that a god would come to them , and set the island right ;</l>
     <l n="24">And how he should be orful tall , and likewise pearly white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Now when they saw this Samuel approachin ’ on his raft ,</l>
     <l n="26">The news through all the island shades was quickly telegrapht ,</l>
     <l n="27">How all their tribulations would speedily be past ,</l>
     <l n="28">’ Cos the long-expected sucker was invadin ’ ’ em at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Now when Sam Jackson stept ashore , as modest as you please ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nine thousand bloomin ’ savages received him on their knees ;</l>
     <l n="31">He looked around in wonderment , regardin ’ it as odd ,</l>
     <l n="32">Not bein ’ much accustomed to be worshipped as a god .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">But he twigged the situation , and with a pleasin ’ smile</l>
     <l n="34">Stretched out his hands , a-blessin ’ all the natives of the isle ;</l>
     <l n="35">He did it well , although his paws were bigger than a pan ,</l>
     <l n="36">Because he was habitual a most politeful man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">So to return their manners , and nary-wise for fun ,</l>
     <l n="38">He raised himself with dignity , and then fired off his gun :</l>
     <l n="39">So all allowed that he must be one of the heavenly chaps ,</l>
     <l n="40">Since he went about with lightning and dispensed with thunderclaps .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">They took him on their shoulders , and he let it go for good ,</l>
     <l n="42">And went into their city in the which a temple stood ,</l>
     <l n="43">And sot him on the altar , and made him their salams ,</l>
     <l n="44">And brought him pleasant coco-nuts , with chickens , po and yams .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And from that day henceforward , in a captivating style ,</l>
     <l n="46">He relegated , as he pleased , the natives of that isle ;</l>
     <l n="47">And when an unbeliever rose — as now and then were some ,</l>
     <l n="48">He cured their irreligion with a little taste of rum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">He settled all their business , and he did it very well ,</l>
     <l n="50">So everything went booming like a blessed wedding bell ;</l>
     <l n="51">Eleven lovely feminines attended to his wants ,</l>
     <l n="52">And a guard of honour followed him to all his usual haunts .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Now what mortal men are made of , that they can ’ t put up with bliss ,</l>
     <l n="54">I do not know , but this I know , that Sam got tired of this ;</l>
     <l n="55">He wished that he was far away , again aboard a ship ,</l>
     <l n="56">And all he thought of — night and day — was givin ’ ’ em the slip .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">And so one night when all was still and every soul asleep ,</l>
     <l n="58">He got into a good canoe and paddled o ’ er the deep ,</l>
     <l n="59">But oh the row the natives made , when early in the morn</l>
     <l n="60">They came to worship Samuel , and found their god was gone !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Then Samuel travelled many days , but had the luck at last</l>
     <l n="62">To meet a brig from Boston where he shipped before the mast ;</l>
     <l n="63">And he gave it as his sentiments , and no one thought it odd ,</l>
     <l n="64">He was better off as sailor than when sailing as a god .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">Now many years had flown away when Samuel was forgot ,</l>
     <l n="66">There came a ship for pearl shell unto that lonely spot ;</l>
     <l n="67">They went into the temple , and what do you suppose</l>
     <l n="68">They found the natives worshipping — a suit of Samuel ’ s clothes !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">And this was the tradition of the people of the soil ,</l>
     <l n="70">How once a great divinity had ruled upon their isle ;</l>
     <l n="71">Four fathom tall , with eyes like fire , and such was their believin ’,</l>
     <l n="72">One night he got upon the moon — and sailed away to Heaven !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">“ Wall , it ’ s a fact ,” cried Doolittle , “ I ’ ll swear</l>
     <l n="74">A rover ain ’ t contented anywhere ;</l>
     <l n="75">But if he is a real sailor slip ,</l>
     <l n="76">He ’ s happiest on the hull — aboard a ship —</l>

     <l n="78">Especially if ’ tis a dandy one</l>
     <l n="79">Where all is fine — O mateys , that ’ s the thing !”</l>
     <l n="80">He raised his voice , and thus began to sing :</l>
     <l n="81">( While up and down he merrily did prance )</l>
     <l n="82">Unto the air of Dance , the Boatman , dance !</l>

     <l n="5">It was in the Middle Ages —’ bout the end of Sixty-eight ,</l>
     <l n="6">So I found the hoary legend written on an ancient slate —</l>
     <l n="7">That one Ezry Jenks prospecting , when he reached this blooming spot ,</l>
     <l n="8">Thus uplifted to his pardner : “ Glory ! Moses , let us squat !”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Thus rebounded Moses Adams : “ Glory was the foremost word</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And this casual conversation in the year of Sixty-eight ,</l>
     <l n="14">As if by an inspiration he recorded on a slate ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which ’ twas said in later ages — six weeks after — used to hang</l>
     <l n="16">As a curiositary in the principal shebang .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">On the spot that very evening they perceived a beauteous gleam</l>
     <l n="18">From a grain of shining metal in a wild auriferous stream :</l>
     <l n="19">As their eyes remarked the symptom thus their tongues responsive</l>
     <l n="20">spoke :</l>
     <l n="21">“ In this undiscovered section there is pay-dirt , sure as smoke !”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">Little boots or little shoes it to inform you how , like crows</l>
     <l n="23">To a carcase , folks came flying , and the town of Glory rose ;</l>
     <l n="24">As in country schools the urchins cast each one a spittle-ball ,</l>
     <l n="25">Till at last a monstrous paper fungus gathers on the wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="26">’ Long the road they built their cabins , in a vis-a-visual way ,</l>
     <l n="27">As if each man to his neighbour kind of wished to have his say ;</l>
     <l n="28">But ’ twas also said that like two rows of teeth the houses grew ,</l>
     <l n="29">Threatening uncommon danger to the stranger passing through .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="30">Yes , for like the note of freedom sounded on Hibernia ’ s harp ,</l>
     <l n="31">Every person in the party was a most uncommon sharp ;</l>
     <l n="32">And it got to be a saying that from such an ornery cuss</l>
     <l n="33">As a regular Gloryvillin — oh , good Law deliver us !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="34">First of all the pay-dirt vanished or became uncommon rare ,</l>
     <l n="35">Then they wandered more than ever to the Cross and from the Square ,</l>
     <l n="36">For when all resources failed them nary copper did they mind ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="38">So they got incopperated as a city fair and grand ,</l>
     <l n="39">Spreading memoirs of their splendour over many a distant land ,</l>
     <l n="40">Mind I say in distant places — people near them knew</l>
     <l n="41">Into what unearthly beauty the great town of Glory grew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="42">Then they sent an ex-tra Governor over seas and far beyond ,</l>

     <l n="44">Splendidly engraved in London , having just the proper touch</l>
     <l n="45">Quite imposing — rather — for they did impose upon the Dutch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="46">And with every bond the Governor had a picture to bestow</l>
     <l n="47">Of the town of Gloryville a-bathing in the sunset ’ s glow ;</l>
     <l n="48">This they had performed in Paris by an artist full of cheek ,</l>

     <l n="51">Out of scenery in an opera , “ Cortez in the Mexico .”</l>
     <l n="52">Therefore all his work expanded with expensive fallacies :</l>

    <head>THE BALLAD OF THE GREEN OLD MAN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was a balmeous day in May , when spring was springing high</l>
     <l n="2">And all amid the buttercups the bees did butterfly ;</l>
     <l n="3">While the butterflies were being enraptured in the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="4">And winsome frogs were singing soft morals to the showers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Green were the emerald grasses which grew upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="6">And green too were the verdant boughs which rippled in the rain ,</l>
     <l n="7">Far green likewise the apple hue which clad the distant hill ,</l>
     <l n="8">But at the station sat a man who looked far greener still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">An ancient man , a boy-like man , a person mild and meek ,</l>
     <l n="10">A being who had little tongue , and nary bit of cheek .</l>
     <l n="11">And while upon him pleasant-like I saw the ladies look ,</l>
     <l n="12">He sat a-counting money in a brownsome pocket-book .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Then to him a policeman spoke : “ Unless you feel too proud ,</l>
     <l n="14">You ’ d better stow away that cash while you ’ re in this here crowd ;</l>
     <l n="15">There ’ s many a chap about this spot who ’ d clean you out like ten .”</l>

     <l n="17">“ Then I will put my greenbacks up all in my pocket-book ,</l>
     <l n="18">And keep it buttoned very tight , and at the button look .”</l>
     <l n="19">He said it with a simple tone , and gave a simple smile —</l>

     <l n="22">While distant frogs were frogging amid the summer showers ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the tree-toads were tree-toadying in accents sharp or flat —</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Then up and down the platform promiscuous he strayed ,</l>

     <l n="49">He saw the game distinctly , and inspected how it took ,</l>
     <l n="50">And watched the reappearance of that brownsome pocket-book ,</l>
     <l n="51">And how that futile ancient , ere he buttoned up his coat ,</l>

    <head>MELODRAMNATION</head>
     <l n="1">“ Now Mr. Gallagher is satisfied .”</l>
     <l n="2">So says the Boston Post . The facts are these :</l>
     <l n="3">He is the chief of a theatric club ,</l>
     <l n="4">And as he deems that he can melodram ,</l>
     <l n="5">He melodrammed for it a mighty piece</l>
     <l n="6">Of thundering incidents and awful scenes ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which called for just nine actors . And they all</l>
     <l n="8">Declared that each had got the worst and curst</l>
     <l n="9">Of all the parts , and that ’ twas written thus</l>
     <l n="10">To boom the fame of selfish Gallagher ;</l>
     <l n="11">So the first night they came upon the boards ,</l>
     <l n="12">With hearts like hornets and with souls like snakes</l>
     <l n="13">And feeling like old pizen , all agog</l>
     <l n="14">To be revenged upon the common foe ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who was to act the hero . Act the first :</l>
     <l n="16">The hero and his mother meet to part ,</l>
     <l n="17">And on her shoulders and o ’ er all her bust</l>
     <l n="18">The parent had put pins by papersful ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till she was like a frightful porcupine ;</l>
     <l n="20">And when she pressed her darling to her breast ,</l>
     <l n="21">The pins en masse entered his very soul ,</l>
     <l n="22">And pricked his nose , and ran into his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="23">So that he howled ; but his mamma held on ,</l>
     <l n="24">Easing her heart with rapturous revenge</l>
     <l n="25">While agonizing his . In the next act</l>
     <l n="26">He was on shipboard , and ’ twas in the plot</l>
     <l n="27">That he should be knocked down and cuffed about</l>
     <l n="28">By a most cruel captain ; and , God knows ,</l>
     <l n="29">The captain played that part most perfectly ,</l>
     <l n="30">Since in the start he went for Gallagher</l>
     <l n="31">With a belaying-pin , and laid him out</l>
     <l n="32">Secundum artem , and then let him up ,</l>
     <l n="33">Only to let into him twice as hot ,</l>
     <l n="34">’ Mid rapturous hurrahs . In the next act</l>
     <l n="35">The hero led the crew to mutiny ,</l>
     <l n="36">And Gallagher was glorious ; but just then</l>
     <l n="37">Some one let down the trap on which he stood ,</l>
     <l n="38">And there he was , up to his waist in stage ,</l>
     <l n="39">Unable to get up or to go down ,</l>
     <l n="40">And thus they kept him in captivity</l>
     <l n="41">While all the audience guyed him . When he strove</l>
     <l n="42">To climb they lowered him , and when he sought</l>
     <l n="43">To dodge beneath they highered him again ;</l>
     <l n="44">So he went up and down like Erie stock</l>
     <l n="45">Until the scene was shifted . In the next</l>
     <l n="46">He fought the villain of the play , and this</l>
     <l n="47">Was Mr. Hencoop Smith , a stalwart rogue ,</l>
     <l n="48">Extremely high on muscle , and the way</l>
     <l n="49">He lathered Gallagher about the stage</l>
     <l n="50">Was Awful Gardener . And when Smith should cry ,</l>
     <l n="51">“ Forgive me — I am crushed !” and Gallagher</l>
     <l n="52">Replied , “ I ’ ll have your life !” the hero lay</l>
     <l n="53">Under the table , while his adversary</l>
     <l n="54">Bemauled him with a chair-leg . It was o ’ er ,</l>
     <l n="55">And Gallagher , all black and blue , went home</l>
     <l n="56">To plotter out revenge . On the next night</l>
     <l n="57">The piece was adverred to be played again ,</l>
     <l n="58">And Gallagher sent round a messenger ,</l>
     <l n="59">Who said he was too ill to play his part ,</l>
     <l n="60">But he would send a substitute . He did —</l>
     <l n="61">A giant-like ferocious prize-fighter ,</l>
     <l n="62">Under another name . And how he played !</l>
     <l n="63">He squeezed the mother into raving fits ,</l>
     <l n="64">And jerked her wig away by accident ,</l>
     <l n="65">And threw the cruel captain down the trap ,</l>
     <l n="66">And larruped all the actors ; and when Smith</l>
     <l n="67">Came on to fight , he took him by the heels</l>
     <l n="68">And mopped the stage with him until ’ twas clean ,</l>
     <l n="69">Then hurled him through the flat . All was a wreck :</l>
     <l n="70">And in the front seat sat the Gallagher</l>
     <l n="71">And laughed until he cried . Revenge is sweet !</l>

My mother pulled my hair , last night , until she made me squall . Of course she knows that she ’ s gone up for anything at all .” “ But there ’ s your father ,” said his friend . “ Well ,— yes — I really thought that I was stuck on the old man , and that he had me caught , and I was kinder looking round to hunt him up a pipe ; but then , this very mornin ’ he hit me such a wipe ! That fixed his Christmas goose for him , and took away his joy . Now all this money ’ s goin ’ to a good and clever boy , to buy him lots of pea-nuts and candy , I ’ ll engage — with caramels ; and that good boy is just my size and age .”</p>

    <head>THE PHILANTHROPIC CLUB</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I am the member of a club of reg ’ lar noble seeds ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose object is to give rewards for philanthropic deeds .</l>
     <l n="3">We root for magnanimity as spiders hunt for flies ,</l>
     <l n="4">So we lately held a meeting to award our annual prize .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Then our President reported with great solemnity</l>
     <l n="6">The case of Dayball Carter , a man in Tennessee ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who plunged into a burning store as if his doom had come ,</l>
     <l n="8">But emergéd with an infant — and a gallon jug of rum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But the club could nowise settle , admitting all the fact ,</l>
     <l n="10">If the baby or the liquor had inspired the noble act ,</l>
     <l n="11">For ’ twas proved he kept the liquor while he let the infant go ,</l>
     <l n="12">So the case of Mr. Carter was adjourned in dubio .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Then the Secretary read us , in very moving tones ,</l>
     <l n="14">The wondrous case of courage of General Pompey Jones ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who found a hydrophobic dog upon a neighbour ’ s farm ,</l>
     <l n="16">And roped his neck and led him off where he could do no harm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Then Brother Chunk , of Pewterville , declared that it was sad</l>
     <l n="18">To have to state that Jones had no idea the dog was mad ,</l>
     <l n="19">And that in circles where he moved ’ twas very freely said</l>
     <l n="20">He ’ d picked it up intending to come out one dog ahead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Then the next case reported in the doings of the day</l>
     <l n="22">Was that of Huckleberry Pod , a man in Iowa ,</l>
     <l n="23">Who slopped into a raging flood to save a drowning maid ,</l>
     <l n="24">And did it like a beaver , as admiring neighbours said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Then Brother Chunk again let down his fist with startling bump ,</l>
     <l n="26">And said he ’ d found that Mr. Pod refused to make the jump</l>
     <l n="27">Till offered fifty dollars by the people of the town ,</l>
     <l n="28">And that then he wouldn ’ t do it till he got the money down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Last of all we heard the instance of Golias Purple Fife ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who went into an awful well to save a fellow ’ s life ,</l>
     <l n="31">A man who always spoke of Fife as of a blooming fool ,</l>
     <l n="32">And who recently had done him blind in trading for a mule ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">And on top of this , moreover , in addition , ’ twas a fact ,</l>
     <l n="34">He refused a quarter-dollar for this noble manly act ,</l>
     <l n="35">And when they asked him what he ’ d drink , or if he ’ d take a bite ,</l>
     <l n="36">He jumped in silence on his mule and rode into the night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">This case , in the opinion of the members of the club ,</l>
     <l n="38">Was much the most deserving , and the nearest to the hub ;</l>
     <l n="39">And each allowed he ’ d never heard the like in all his life ,</l>
     <l n="40">So , by general acclamation , they bestowed the prize on Fife :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">A silver-plated snuff-box , with a compass in the lid ,</l>
     <l n="42">With the words , “ If sold at auction always do as you are bid ,”</l>
     <l n="43">Which we sent him in a hurry ere it might be understood</l>
     <l n="44">That this , too , was not an instance of the pure unmingled good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And these are the proceedings of these noble-minded seeds ,</l>
     <l n="46">Who make it their profession to discover virtuous deeds ;</l>
     <l n="47">And every day turns out a lot , but still ’ tis on our mind</l>
     <l n="48">That a case without a speck in it is very hard to find .</l>

    <head>THE MASHER</head>
    <head>The word to “ mash ,” in the sense of causing love or attracting by a glance or fascinating look , came into ordinary slang from the American stage . Thus an actress was often fined for “ mashing ” or smiling at men in the audience . It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors , C ., among whom Romany was habitually spoken . The word “ masher ” or “ mash ” means in that tongue to allure , delude , or entice . It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by its quasi-identity with the English word . A girl could be called a masher as she could be called a man-killer , or killing . But there can be no doubt as to the gypsy origin of “ mash ” as used on the stage . I am indebted for this information to the late well-known impresario Palmer of New York , and I made a note of it years before the term had become at all popular .</head>

     <l n="1">It was in the Indian summer-time , when life is tender brown ,</l>

     <l n="5">It was in the railroad deepô of that greatly-favoured zone ,</l>

     <l n="37">The Chief Musician of the Holy House ;</l>
     <l n="38">And knowing that the man who bloweth up</l>
     <l n="39">A pair of bagpipes also is the one</l>
     <l n="40">Who plays upon the same — drew inference</l>
     <l n="41">That the deceased was the true organist ,</l>
     <l n="42">And he who played thereon his humble aid ,</l>
     <l n="43">Who only worked to keep the tune in time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">Now being smitten with a deep desire</l>
     <l n="45">To rise in life and also to be called</l>
     <l n="46">A Child of Art — with a nice salary —</l>
     <l n="47">And have a sermon preached o ’ er him when dead ,</l>
     <l n="48">Giannolo unto the Bishop went ,</l>
     <l n="49">And made a great entreaty to be placed</l>
     <l n="50">Among the holy followers of Saint Mark ,</l>
     <l n="51">And that the aim of his ambition was</l>
     <l n="52">Alzare i mantici quando suonava</l>
     <l n="53">gli organi — that ’ s to say :</l>
     <l n="54">“ To lift the bellows when the organ played .”</l>
     <l n="55">And as he was a stout and lusty knave</l>
     <l n="56">Who might be useful in a hundred ways ,</l>
     <l n="57">They gladly took him on , so there he stayed</l>
     <l n="58">Blowing the bellows faithfully in time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">I ween there is not in all Italy</l>
     <l n="60">A man — unless he came from Bergamo —</l>
     <l n="61">Who could have blown an organ seven years</l>
     <l n="62">In the full faith that he was playing it ,</l>
     <l n="63">And was indeed the real organist .</l>
     <l n="64">Yet this , in fact , unless the legend lies ,</l>
     <l n="65">Was what befell Giannolo . By this time ,</l>
     <l n="66">Having laid by a very handsome sum ,</l>
     <l n="67">And being well attired though modestly ,</l>
     <l n="68">As is becoming to a Son of Art ,</l>
     <l n="69">He went a-visiting his native place ,</l>
     <l n="70">Where all who were related unto him —</l>
     <l n="71">That is to say about one-half the town —</l>
     <l n="72">Did greatly marvel at his handsome clothes</l>
     <l n="73">And at his air of stately dignity ,</l>
     <l n="74">But most of all when he informed them that</l>
     <l n="75">He was no more a porter : he had felt</l>
     <l n="76">Immortal longings in him to arise</l>
     <l n="77">Above that vulgar calling , and to soar</l>
     <l n="78">“’ Mid palpitations sweet and pleasures soft ,</l>
     <l n="79">The manifestations of that beauteous life</l>
     <l n="80">Diffused unseen throughout eternal Space ”</l>
     <l n="81">Which men call Music ; and that he had risen</l>
     <l n="82">Even to a monthly salary of ten francs ,</l>
     <l n="83">Wherewith were many pleasing perquisites ;</l>
     <l n="84">And that he played the organ in Saint Mark ’ s ,</l>
     <l n="85">As all the world allowed , in perfect time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="86">Up rose a buzz of strangest wonderment ,</l>
     <l n="87">Or , as ’ tis writ , Di che restarono</l>
     <l n="88">Più maravigliati ; for they all</l>
     <l n="89">Were much amazed that such a common man —</l>
     <l n="90">Si vile e si rozzo — such a boor —</l>
     <l n="91">Had risen to the pinnacle of Art</l>
     <l n="92">In Venice , where all Art was at its height ,</l>
     <l n="93">And gained the crown of glory — Iddio !</l>
     <l n="94">“ Ten francs a month besides the perquisites !”</l>
     <l n="95">They bowed before him with deep reverence ,</l>
     <l n="96">Hoping he ’ d stay with them a little time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="97">Then some one spoke with hesitating tone ,</l>
     <l n="98">As if in fear to take a liberty ,</l>
     <l n="99">And said : “ Your Excellence — if we might dare —</l>
     <l n="100">Since we would celebrate the kind return</l>
     <l n="101">Of such an Honour to our noble town ,</l>
     <l n="102">Would you not grace the occasion , and increase</l>
     <l n="103">Our joy and sense of deep respectfulness ,</l>
     <l n="104">By playing Vespers for us in the Dome</l>
     <l n="105">On Sunday next ?” Giannolo bowed low ,</l>
     <l n="106">And in a speech adorned with many flowers ,</l>
     <l n="107">Which he had culled from sermons in Saint Mark ,</l>
     <l n="108">Acceded gracefully to their request ,</l>
     <l n="109">And said he would be there to play , in time .</l>
     <l n="110">When Sunday came there came with it a crowd</l>
     <l n="111">Such as Bergamo never saw before ,</l>
     <l n="112">For in her streets and past her palaces</l>
     <l n="113">Thousands in holiday attire swept on ,</l>
     <l n="114">And even afar there was a thundering roar ,</l>
     <l n="115">From time to time , which rolled from square to square ,</l>
     <l n="116">As when the incoming ocean , with a tide</l>
     <l n="117">Urged by a tempest , breaks among the rocks .</l>
     <l n="118">Yea , there were many — tanto popolo —</l>
     <l n="119">All that the church would hold , and then outside</l>
     <l n="120">A vast , impatient , brilliant multitude ,</l>
     <l n="121">Such as had ne ’ er been there at any time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="122">And at the appointed hour Giannolo came ,</l>
     <l n="123">Rising before the people in his state ,</l>
     <l n="124">Waiting awhile the appearance of the man</l>
     <l n="125">Who was to play the organ while he — blew !</l>
     <l n="126">And all the congregation waited too ,</l>
     <l n="127">All staring steadily at the great man</l>
     <l n="128">In anxious expectation , till at last</l>
     <l n="129">Giannolo from the pulpit cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="130">“ Where is the man who is to touch the keys ?</l>
     <l n="131">What is the use of making music , hey —</l>
     <l n="132">And filling up the thing with melody ,</l>
     <l n="133">As I have come to do , unless there be</l>
     <l n="134">Some one to click the bones and let it out ?</l>
     <l n="135">You don ’ t suppose that I can raise the wind ,</l>
     <l n="136">And steer , and sail the ship as well , my friends .</l>
     <l n="137">Such things were ne ’ er beheld at any time .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="138">There was an instant ’ s silence — deep and strange ;</l>
     <l n="139">In all the great cathedral rang no sound .</l>
     <l n="140">All stared at one another open-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="141">Or at Giannolo — just as if some power</l>
     <l n="142">Before unknown in life had seized on them</l>
     <l n="143">With a tremendous sense of dire amaze ,</l>
     <l n="144">Not knowing what the devil it could mean ;</l>
     <l n="145">When all at once they took — and from them all</l>
     <l n="146">There rose a roar of laughter like a crash</l>
     <l n="147">Of thunder , and so near it that one seemed</l>
     <l n="148">To miss the lightning — or , as I might say ,</l>
     <l n="149">’ Twas like a flash of sound — and then again</l>
     <l n="150">It came re-echoed from the multitude</l>
     <l n="151">Gathered outside , as the electric peal</l>
     <l n="152">Resounds , repeated by the mountain tops .</l>
     <l n="153">Yea , such a peal of laughter as the book</l>
     <l n="154">Declares “ at vespers ne ’ er was heard before ,”</l>
     <l n="155">And ne ’ er again will be at any time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="156">Moral . I pray you think upon it well .</l>
     <l n="157">There are full many people in this world</l>
     <l n="158">Who think that they are wondrous wise in ART ,</l>
     <l n="159">And who , as Critics , write about the same</l>
     <l n="160">In transcendental phrase with capitals ,</l>
     <l n="161">And call it Faith , and Love , and Heaven knows what ,</l>
     <l n="162">And cannot think of it without a gasp</l>
     <l n="163">And uttering phrases silly , mystical ,—</l>
     <l n="164">Because they are the empty , windy ones ,</l>
     <l n="165">Inflating and inflated , who but blow</l>
     <l n="166">The bellows of the organ , yet believe</l>
     <l n="167">That they are leaders in the Realm of Art !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Among the merry tales of olden time</l>
     <l n="2">Which are still current in fair Italy</l>
     <l n="3">Are many told in taverns or in type</l>
     <l n="4">About the rude barbarians of the North</l>
     <l n="5">Who cross the Alps , even as they did of yore ,</l>
     <l n="6">When they invaded fertile Lombardy ,</l>
     <l n="7">And helped themselves to all which pleased their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">And paid for it in iron and with blood :</l>
     <l n="9">Those times are fled , but Northmen still are here ;</l>
     <l n="10">States fall , arts fade , but English yet abound ,</l>
     <l n="11">And Austrian-Germans and Americans</l>
     <l n="12">Stalk proudly through the streets with Baedeker ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or Murray , with the very gait and air</l>
     <l n="14">Of their barbarian ancestors — although</l>
     <l n="15">They are cleaner washed and more completely shaved —</l>
     <l n="16">Bet high upon the latter ; for as once</l>
     <l n="17">They came to rob the natives of their goods ,</l>

     <l n="27">Wherein they wellnigh rival Baltimore —</l>

     <l n="30">“ Sono forestieri ”— which indeed</l>
     <l n="31">Means “ They are foreigners ”— and yet the word</l>

     <l n="40">Yet do not add by the process — that I see —</l>
     <l n="41">Aught to its value ; but the odd result</l>
     <l n="42">Was that the Gothic warriors nothing knew</l>
     <l n="43">About the mystery of the Trinity ,—</l>
     <l n="44">Nay , they were even far more ignorant</l>
     <l n="45">Than was the English curate , who when asked</l>

     <l n="54">Went stalking onwards through the streets of Rome ,</l>

     <l n="72">With thoughts of dinner flitting through his soul ,</l>

     <l n="74">The picture of a dove with outspread wings</l>
     <l n="75">Above the door of a trattoria ,</l>
     <l n="76">Which means a place where you can treat yourself</l>

     <l n="85">Those who o ’ erheard him deemed him a devout</l>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="1">ORBUS IN TACTU MAINET .— P . 2</p>
    <p n="2">THERE were in Philadelphia , forty years ago , two sailors ’ groggeries in Water Street , both having the sign of The Boy and Barrel , derived from the infant Bacchus . One of these had for motto the words exactly as here misspelt and divided .</p>
    <p n="3">TIME FOR US TO GO .— P . 64</p>
    <p n="4">In one of his admirable papers , “ At the Sign of the Ship ,” published in the Cornhill Magazine , Mr. Andrew Lang , in discussing Sea Songs , wrote the following :—</p>
    <p n="5">“ In an unpublished play by Mr. Henley and Mr. R. L. Stevenson , a play called Admiral Guinea , that veteran ruffian , Mr. Pew of Treasure Island , makes his appearance . He has been a sailor of Admiral Guinea ’ s in the slave trade , and he haunts the evangelical and remorseful Admiral like an evil conscience , singing snatches of the following ‘ Slaver ’ s Song .’ Mr. Henley has kindly copied out the whole piece , which was published in Mr. Leland ’ s ‘ Captain Jonas Fisher ’ in Temple Bar about fourteen years ago . Whether the ballad is traditional and collected by Mr. Leland , or whether to himself is due the great credit of the authorship , I am not aware .”</p>
    <p n="6">Truly I am not the author of the song which I picked up in Philadelphia before the War , nor do I know who wrote it . I am tolerably certain , however , that I , having slightly retouched it , republished it in Temple Bar as quoted . There are , however , others besides Mr. Lang who think I wrote it , so I give it here in order to make truth known , but chiefly because it is in keeping with other specimens of sailors ’ lyrical folk-lore in these pages , and will be acceptable to all who like such ballads .</p>
    <p n="7">SAMUEL JACKSON .— P . 99</p>
    <p n="8">“ And of the heathen natives with their suppositious wiles .”</p>
    <p n="9">I once crossed the Atlantic in a sailing-vessel , sharing my state-room with a veteran sea-captain who had been for forty years in the whaling service . He had an inexhaustible stock of sea-folk-lore , which he freely imparted to me who was an eager listener , and as the voyage lasted thirty-five days I had opportunity to gather much . I am indebted to him for this amusing interchange of words . When telling me that he once went incognito to revisit his old home in Connecticut he said , “ I passed under a superstitious name .”</p>
