    <head>INTRODUCTION Borrow and the Kjæmpeviser .</head>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The modern poetical literature of Denmark opens with a collection of epical and lyrical poems from the Middle Ages , which are loosely connected under the title of Kjæmpeviser or Heroic Ballads . Of these the latest scholarship recognises nearly 500 , but in the time of Borrow the number did not much exceed 200 . These ballads deal with half-historic events , which are so completely masked by fantastic , supernatural and incoherent imagery that their positive relation to history can rarely be discovered . Nevertheless , they throw a very valuable light upon the manners of mediaeval society in Scandinavia , and they are often of high poetical beauty . No conjecture can be formed as to the authors of these ballads , and even the centuries in which they were composed are uncertain . Grimm believed them to be uralt , and attributed them to the 5th and 6th centuries . But on linguistic grounds , this extreme antiquity cannot be maintained . It is now supposed that they were composed at various times between 1300 and 1500 , and that in their present form they bear the stamp of the period when they were first collected by the Danish antiquaries of the sixteenth century .</p>
   <p>The circumstances in which this famous collection of folk-songs came into public notice were of a romantic nature . Sophia , Queen of Denmark , when sailing across the Sound in the year 1586 , was driven by stress of weather to take shelter in the little island-harbour of Hveen , where the famous observatory stood , close by the house of the astronomer , Tycho Brahe . It so happened that at that very time Brahe was entertaining as a guest the most eminent Danish man of letters of that age , Anders Sörensen Vedel ( 1542 – 1616 ) . Vedel , whose labours were encyclopædic , was engaged in preserving all the monuments of Danish mediaeval history and learning which he could discover in the monasteries and libraries of Denmark . He had been much encouraged in this work by the Monk of Roeskilde , Peder Olufsen , who on his death-bed , about 1570 , had placed in Vedel ’ s hands all the MSS . which he had collected . Queen Sophia , cloistered in the Ouranienborg with her antiquary and her astronomer , and waiting for the tempest to moderate , desired to be amused with stories of her national history . Vedel ventured to read to her some of the legendary poems which still lingered among the people , and she was so enchanted with them , that she commanded him , when he returned to the mainland , to make a collection of these ballads and publish them .</p>
   <p>Accordingly , in 1591 , Vedel issued from the private printing-press in his house called Liljeborg at Ribe in Jutland , a selection of 100 mediaeval ballads , under the title of Et Hundred udvalgte danske Viser . This volume is one of the landmarks of Scandinavian , and indeed of European , literary history . Vedel made another collection , this time of ancient love-ballads , which he called Tragica ; it was not published until 1657 , long after his death . But the volume of 1591 is the fountain-head of all that has since been written about the Heroic Ballads of the North , and it is impossible to overrate the services of Vedel in preserving what was even then ready to disappear . It seems , moreover , that he was careful of the text , and later scholarship has come more and more to place confidence in his transcripts .</p>
   <p>This was , unfortunately , not the case with the next pioneer in the same field , although he deserves great credit also . Peter Petersen Syv ( 1631 – 1702 ) was a very able philologist , who was also a minor poet of ambition . In 1695 he reprinted and edited Vedel ’ s text , adding 100 more kjæmpeviser which had been unknown to Vedel . But his work was not so well done ; Syv was something of a pedant , and unfortunately either too critical or not critical enough . He ventured to correct the irregularities of the ballads , and not seldom has spoiled them . He bore the proud title of Philologer Royal of Denmark , and he was above all things else a grammarian . But he added to our store of Ballads . No one , during the eighteenth century , advanced on the labours of Vedel and Syv , and their treasuries of beautiful anonymous poetry seem to have attracted no attention in the rest of Europe .</p>
   <p>But in the first decade of the nineteenth century , in consequence of what we call the Romantic Revival , poets and scholars in many countries turned simultaneously to the treasure-house of Danish balladry . Jamieson ’ s work , to which I shall presently return , dates from 1806 ; about the same time Herder translated one or two kjæmpeviser in his Stimmen der Völker , and in 1809 Wilhelm Carl Grimm started his full translation , under the title of Altdänische Heldenlieder , Balladen and Märchen , which appeared in 1811 . But it appears that Grimm had heard and perhaps even seen the proofs of a Danish edition of the very highest importance , the Udvalgte Danske Viser fra Middlealderen , the first volume of which was brought out by Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek in 1812 . { 9 } Abrahamson dropped out , but the work was completed by the others , the fifth and last volume appearing in 1814 .</p>
   <p>Borrow ’ s relation to these texts must now be considered , and it offers some difficulty . In 1826 he published a volume of verse entitled Romantic Ballads translated from the Danish , and in the preface he uses these words :—“ I expect shortly to lay before the public a complete translation of the KIÆMPÉ VISER , made by me some years ago .” It is necessary to bear in mind that there are these two collections of Borrow ’ s translations from the kjæmpeviser , the second of which , as we shall see , he did not contrive to publish .</p>
   <p>No doubt , he was anxious to emphasise the novelty and rarity of his literary adventures . But his attitude to Jamieson is very strange . As early as 1806 Robert Jamieson ( 1780 – 1844 ) had published a volume of Popular Ballads , in which he had translated several of the kjæmpeviser and had pointed out their value in relation to the ancient Scottish poems of a similar kind . Sir Walter Scott paid much flattering attention to Jamieson ’ s work , which also attracted a good deal of notice in Denmark and Germany , and inspired the Drei altschottische Lieder of G. D. Gräter ( 1813 ) . It is scarcely possible that Borrow was not aware of all this , yet he never mentions the name of Jamieson , and in 1826 he spoke boldly of himself as breaking into “ unknown and untrodden paths .” It is not impossible that Sir Walter Scott ’ s patronage of Jamieson had something to do with the ungenerous petulance of Borrow ’ s references to the great novelist in Lavengro .</p>
   <p>But Borrow ’ s attitude to the contemporary scholars of Denmark is still more surprising . Without saying so in exact words , he gives us to understand that he translated all the kjæmpeviser from the original edition of Vedel . It would be rash to say that Borrow was not acquainted with the Danske Viser of 1591 , for he does , in one place , quote , whether at first-hand or not , from Vedel ’ s preface . But it requires great faith to accept his own account of his approach to the poems . In Lavengro , at a point which Knapp has dated 1820 , Borrow tells with brilliant picturesqueness how he purchased , by permitting the wife of an elderly yeoman to kiss his cheek , “ a strange and uncouth-looking volume ” which had formed part of the kit of some red-haired fishermen who were wrecked on the Norfolk coast :—</p>
   <p>It was not very large , but instead of the usual covering was bound in wood , and was compassed with strong iron clasps . It was a printed book , but the pages were not of paper , but vellum , and the characters were black , and resembled those generally termed Gothic . . . . And now I had in my possession a Danish book , which , from its appearance , might be supposed to have belonged to the very old Danes indeed : but how was I to turn it to any account ? I had the book it is true , but I did not understand the language , and how was I to overcome that difficulty ? Hardly by poring over the book ; yet I did pore over the book again , but with all my poring I could not understand it ; and then I became angry , and I bit my lips till the blood came ; and I occasionally tore a handful from my hair and flung it upon the floor , but that did not mend the matter , for still I did not understand the book , which however I began to see was written in rhyme . . . . For the book was a book of ballads , about the deeds of knights and champions , and men of huge stature . . . . collected by one Anders Vedel .</p>
   <p>This story of a vellum copy of the rare edition of 1591 thrown up on the shore of Norfolk with a common sailor ’ s effects is told in Borrow ’ s best style . But how far is it true ? Whether it is entirely or only partly romance , the inference that Borrow translated the kjæmpeviser by the light of nature from this “ Gothic ” text must be abandoned . He may or may not have handled a copy of Vedel , but he made his translations , as internal evidence amply proves , from the five volumes of Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek , published between 1812 and 1814 . This was a cheap and highly accessible edition , and was in the hands of the booksellers complete at least six years before Borrow began to read Danish . He accepted the text of these scholars and their arrangement ; he translated their notes word for word ,— and gave them out as his own ; his volume of 1826 and the privately printed later ballads are wholly founded upon Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek , and yet , so far as I can discover , he never mentions their names in any part of his writings . He professed that the public should believe his knowledge to be wholly derived from a mysterious black-letter volume washed up on the sands of his native county , and read by him with agonies of labour by the pure light of divination .</p>
   <p>In January , 1830 , a prospectus was put forth in which “ The Songs of Scandinavia , translated by Dr. Bowring and Mr. Borrow ” was offered to subscribers at the price of a guinea . This was an attempt on the part of Borrow , languidly assented to by Bowring , to give publicity to some 70 kjæmpeviser which the former had translated since the publication of his Romantic Ballads of 1826 . “ I am terribly afraid ,” writes Borrow , “ of being forestalled in the Kæmpe Viser by some of those Scotch blackguards ,” a hit , no doubt , at Jamieson . He was working hard at his translations , and he was further stimulated by meeting in London with the Danish theologian and poetical student , Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig , who had done much to popularise the kjæmpeviser in his native country . But Bowring proved a broken reed , and Borrow suffered once again one of those disappointments which so naturally embittered him . It was not until 1874 , however , some seven years before his death , that he finally gave up all hope . The MSS . of his translations of the kjæmpeviser passed into the hands of Mrs. MacOubrey .</p>
   <p>The ballad of Grimhild ’ s Vengeance ( Grimhilds Hevn ) is given in three versions by Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek . Borrow has closely followed the editors of 1812 and has translated each of the versions . He added a number of notes , the MS. of which is mutilated , but not so much so as to prevent us from observing that these are translated word for word from the appendix of Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek , but , so far as can be discerned from the fragmentary and mutilated Manuscripts at our disposal , without a sign of acknowledgment .</p>

   <p>{ 9 } The question of priority is rather obscure , but it appears , from a letter written by Grimm in February , 1813 , in reply to the critics of his work , that his translation was begun in 1801 , when he was not aware of the work undertaken by Abrahamson , Nyerup and Rahbek , but that before his book was published , Nyerup communicated to him some of the results of the investigations of the three Danish editors . Grimm seems to have worked upon an edition of Syv published in Copenhagen in 1787 , which accounts for the corrupt state of some of Grimm ’ s text . A good deal of unpleasant controversy was awakened on the subject , but all this has now long slumbered under the dust of a century .</p>
