      <l n="33">And the red sunbeams fading from the wall ,</l>
      <l n="34">On which they flung a sky , with streaks and bars</l>
      <l n="35">Of the poor window-pane that let them in ,</l>
      <l n="36">For clouds and shadings of the mimic heaven !</l>
      <l n="37">Soul of my cell , they part , no more to come .</l>
      <l n="38">But what is light to me , while I am dark !</l>
      <l n="39">And yet they strangely draw me , those faint hues ,</l>
      <l n="40">Reflected flushes from the Evening 's face ,</l>
      <l n="41">Which as a bride , with glowing arms outstretched ,</l>
      <l n="42">Takes to her blushing heaven him who has left</l>
      <l n="43">His chamber in the dim deserted east .</l>
      <l n="44">Through walls and hills I see it ! The rosy sea !</l>
      <l n="45">The radiant head half-sunk ! A pool of light ,</l>
      <l n="46">As the blue globe had by a blow been broken ,</l>
      <l n="47">And the insphered glory bubbled forth !</l>
      <l n="48">Or the sun were a splendid water-bird ,</l>
      <l n="49">That flying furrowed with its golden feet</l>
      <l n="50">A flashing wake over the waves , and home !</l>
      <l n="51">Lo there !— Alas , the dull blank wall !— High up ,</l>
      <l n="52">The window-pane a dead gray eye ! and night</l>
      <l n="53">Come on me like a thief !— Ah , well ! the sun</l>
      <l n="54">Has always made me sad ! I 'll go and pray :</l>

      <l n="75">And fair , convolved sounds troop in to me ,</l>
      <l n="76">Stealing my soul with faint deliciousness .</l>
      <l n="77">Would they took shapes ! What levees I should hold !</l>
      <l n="78">How should my cell be filled with wavering forms !</l>

      <l n="87">Of that night when the closing door fell dumb</l>
      <l n="88">On music and on voices , and I went</l>
      <l n="89">Forth from the ordered tumult of the dance ,</l>
      <l n="90">Under the clear cope of the moonless night ,</l>
      <l n="91">Wandering away without the city-walls ,</l>
      <l n="92">Between the silent meadows and the stars ,</l>
      <l n="93">Till something woke in me , and moved my spirit ,</l>
      <l n="94">And of themselves my thoughts turned toward God ;</l>
      <l n="95">When straight within my soul I felt as if</l>
      <l n="96">An eye was opened ; but I knew not whether</l>
      <l n="97">‘ Twas I that saw , or God that looked on me ?</l>
      <l n="98">It closed again , and darkness fell ; but not</l>
      <l n="99">To hide the memory ; that , in many failings</l>
      <l n="100">Of spirit and of purpose , still returned ;</l>
      <l n="101">And I came here at last to search for God .</l>
      <l n="102">Would I could find him ! Oh , what quiet content</l>
      <l n="103">Would then absorb my heart , yet leave it free !</l>

     <l n="4">Each a skinny male Magdalene ,</l>

   <p>Stephen . We 've found the badger 's hole ; we 'll draw him next . He could n't have gone far with her and not be seen . My life on it , there are plenty of holes and corners in the old house over the way . Run off with a wench ! Holy brother Julian ! Contemptuous brother Julian ! Stand-by-thyself brother Julian ! Run away with a wench at last ! Well , there 's a downfall ! He 'll be for marrying her on the sly , and away !— I know the old fox !— for her conscience-sake , probably not for his ! Well , one comfort is , it 's damnation and no reprieve . The ungrateful , atheistical heretic ! As if the good old mother was n't indulgent enough to the foibles of her children ! The worthy lady has winked so hard at her dutiful sons , that she 's nearly blind with winking . There 's nothing in a little affair with a girl now and then ; but to marry , and knock one 's vows on the head ! Therein is displayed a little ancestral fact as to a certain respectable progenitor , commonly portrayed as the knight of the cloven foot . Keep back thy servant , &amp; c .— Purgatory could n't cleanse that ; and more , ‘ twill never have the chance . Heaven be about us from harm ! Amen . I 'll go find the new count . The Church shall have the castle and estate ; Revenge , in the person of the new count , the body of Julian ; and Stephen may as well have the thousand pieces as not .</p>

   <p>SCENE I .— Night . London . A large meanly furnished room ; a single candle on the table ; a child asleep in a little crib . JULIAN sits by the table , reading in a low voice out of a book . He looks older , and his hair is lined with grey ; his eyes look clearer .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Julian .</l>
     <l n="2">What is this ? let me see ; ‘ tis called The Singer :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Melchah stood looking on the corpse of his son , and spoke not . At length he broke the silence and said : ‘ He hath told his tale to the Immortals . ’ Abdiel , the friend of him that was dead , asked him what he meant by the words . The old man , still regarding the dead body , spake as follows :— ”</p>
   <p>“ Three years ago , I fell asleep on the summit of the hill Yarib ; and there I dreamed a dream . I thought I lay at the foot of a cliff , near the top of a great mountain ; for beneath me were the clouds , and above me , the heavens deep and dark . And I heard voices sweet and strong ; and I lifted up my eyes , and , Lo ! over against me , on a rocky slope , some seated , each on his own crag , some reclining between the fragments , I saw a hundred majestic forms , as of men who had striven and conquered . Then I heard one say : ‘ What wouldst thou sing unto us , young man ? ’ A youthful voice replied , tremblingly : ‘ A song which I have made for my singing . ’ ‘ Come , then , and I will lead thee to the hole in the rock : enter and sing . ’ From the assembly came forth one whose countenance was calm unto awfulness ; but whose eyes looked in love , mingled with doubt , on the face of a youth whom he led by the hand toward the spot where I lay . The features of the youth I could not discern : either it was the indistinctness of a dream , or I was not permitted to behold them . And , Lo ! behind me was a great hole in the rock , narrow at the entrance , but deep and wide within ; and when I looked into it , I shuddered ; for I thought I saw , far down , the glimmer of a star . The youth entered and vanished . His guide strode back to his seat ; and I lay in terror near the mouth of the vast cavern . When I looked up once more , I saw all the men leaning forward , with head aside , as if listening intently to a far-off sound . I likewise listened ; but , though much nearer than they , I heard nothing . But I could see their faces change like waters in a windy and half-cloudy day . Sometimes , though I heard nought , it seemed to me as if one sighed and prayed beside me ; and once I heard a clang of music triumphant in hope ; but I looked up , and , Lo ! it was the listeners who stood on their feet and sang . They ceased , sat down , and listened as before . At last one approached me , and I ventured to question him . ‘ Sir , ’ I said , ‘ wilt thou tell me what it means ? ’ And he answered me thus : ‘ The youth desired to sing to the Immortals . It is a law with us that no one shall sing a song who cannot be the hero of his tale — who cannot live the song that he sings ; for what right hath he else to devise great things , and to take holy deeds in his mouth ? Therefore he enters the cavern where God weaves the garments of souls ; and there he lives in the forms of his own tale ; for God gives them being that he may be tried . The sighs which thou didst hear were his longings after his own Ideal ; and thou didst hear him praying for the Truth he beheld , but could not reach . We sang , because , in his first great battle , he strove well and overcame . We await the next . ’ A deep sleep seemed to fall upon me ; and when I awoke , I saw the Immortals standing with their eyes fixed on the mouth of the cavern . I arose and turned toward it likewise . The youth came forth . His face was worn and pale , as that of the dead man before me ; but his eyes were open , and tears trembled within them . Yet not the less was it the same face , the face of my son , I tell thee ; and in joy and fear I gazed upon him . With a weary step he approached the Immortals . But he who had led him to the cave hastened to meet him , spread forth his arms , and embraced him , and said unto him : ‘ Thou hast told a noble tale ; sing to us now what songs thou wilt . ’ Therefore said I , as I gazed on my son : ‘ He hath told his tale to the Immortals . ’ ”</p>

     <l n="1">And so five years have poured their silent streams ,</l>
     <l n="2">Flowing from fountains in eternity ,</l>
     <l n="3">Into my soul , which , as an infinite gulf ,</l>
     <l n="4">Hath swallowed them ; whose living caves they feed ;</l>
     <l n="5">And time to spirit grows , transformed and kept .</l>
     <l n="6">And now the day draws nigh when Christ was born ;</l>
     <l n="7">The day that showed how like to God himself</l>
     <l n="8">Man had been made , since God could be revealed</l>
     <l n="9">By one that was a man with men , and still</l>
     <l n="10">Was one with God the Father ; that men might</l>
     <l n="11">By drawing nigh to him draw nigh to God ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who had come near to them in tenderness .</l>
     <l n="13">O God ! I thank thee for the friendly eye</l>
     <l n="14">That oft hath opened on me these five years ;</l>
     <l n="15">Thank thee for those enlightenings of my spirit</l>
     <l n="16">That let me know thy thought was toward me ;</l>
     <l n="17">Those moments fore-enjoyed from future years ,</l>
     <l n="18">Telling what converse I should hold with God .</l>
     <l n="19">I thank thee for the sorrow and the care ,</l>
     <l n="20">Through which they gleamed , bright phosphorescent sparks</l>
     <l n="21">Crushed from the troubled waters , borne on which</l>
     <l n="22">Through mist and dark my soul draws nigh to thee .</l>
     <l n="23">Five years ago , I prayed in agony</l>
     <l n="24">That thou wouldst speak to me . Thou wouldst not then ,</l>
     <l n="25">With that close speech I craved so hungrily .</l>
     <l n="26">Thy inmost speech is heart embracing heart ;</l>
     <l n="27">And thou wast all the time instructing me</l>
     <l n="28">To know the language of thy inmost speech .</l>
     <l n="29">I thought thou didst refuse , when every hour</l>
     <l n="30">Thou spakest every word my heart could hear ,</l>
     <l n="31">Though oft I did not know it was thy voice .</l>
     <l n="32">My prayer arose from lonely wastes of soul ;</l>
     <l n="33">As if a world far-off in depths of space ,</l>
     <l n="34">Chaotic , had implored that it might shine</l>
     <l n="35">Straightway in sunlight as the morning star .</l>
     <l n="36">My soul must be more pure ere it could hold</l>
     <l n="37">With thee communion . ‘ Tis the pure in heart</l>
     <l n="38">That shall see God . As if a well that lay</l>
     <l n="39">Unvisited , till water-weeds had grown</l>
     <l n="40">Up from its depths , and woven a thick mass</l>
     <l n="41">Over its surface , could give back the sun !</l>
     <l n="42">Or , dug from ancient battle-plain , a shield</l>
     <l n="43">Could be a mirror to the stars of heaven !</l>
     <l n="44">And though I am not yet come near to him ,</l>
     <l n="45">I know I am more nigh ; and am content</l>
     <l n="46">To walk a long and weary road to find</l>
     <l n="47">My father 's house once more . Well may it be</l>
     <l n="48">A long and weary — I had wandered far .</l>
     <l n="49">My God , I thank thee , thou dost care for me .</l>
     <l n="50">I am content , rejoicing to go on ,</l>
     <l n="51">Even when my home seems very far away ;</l>
     <l n="52">For over grief , and aching emptiness ,</l>
     <l n="53">And fading hopes , a higher joy arises .</l>
     <l n="54">In cloudiest nights , one lonely spot is bright ,</l>

     <l n="135">Just as it comes on any other day :</l>
     <l n="136">A feeble child he came , yet not the less</l>
     <l n="137">Brought godlike childhood to the aged earth ,</l>
     <l n="138">Where nothing now is common any more .</l>
     <l n="139">All things had hitherto proclaimed God :</l>
     <l n="140">The wide spread air ; the luminous mist that hid</l>
     <l n="141">The far horizon of the fading sea ;</l>
     <l n="142">The low persistent music evermore</l>
     <l n="143">Flung down upon the sands , and at the base</l>
     <l n="144">Of the great rocks that hold it as a cup ;</l>
     <l n="145">All things most common ; the furze , now golden , now</l>
     <l n="146">Opening dark pods in music to the heat</l>
     <l n="147">Of the high summer-sun at afternoon ;</l>
     <l n="148">The lone black tarn upon the round hill-top ,</l>
     <l n="149">O'er which the gray clouds brood like rising smoke ,</l>
     <l n="150">Sending its many rills , o'erarched and hid ,</l>
     <l n="151">Singing like children down the rocky sides ;—</l>
     <l n="152">Where shall I find the most unnoticed thing ,</l>
     <l n="153">For that sang God with all its voice of song ?</l>
     <l n="154">But men heard not , they knew not God in these ;</l>
     <l n="155">To their strange speech unlistening ears were strange ;</l>
     <l n="156">For with a stammering tongue and broken words ,</l>
     <l n="157">With mingled falsehoods and denials loud ,</l>
     <l n="158">Man witnessed God unto his fellow man :</l>
     <l n="159">How then himself the voice of Nature hear ?</l>
     <l n="160">Or how himself he heeded , when , the leader ,</l>
     <l n="161">He in the chorus sang a discord vile ?</l>
     <l n="162">When prophet lies , how shall the people preach ?</l>
     <l n="163">But when He came in poverty , and low ,</l>
     <l n="164">A real man to half-unreal men ,</l>
     <l n="165">A man whose human thoughts were all divine ,</l>

     <l n="167">Then God shone forth from all the lowly earth ,</l>
     <l n="168">And men began to read their maker there .</l>
     <l n="169">Now the Divine descends , pervading all .</l>
     <l n="170">Earth is no more a banishment from heaven ;</l>
     <l n="171">But a lone field among the distant hills ,</l>
     <l n="172">Well ploughed and sown , whence corn is gathered home .</l>
     <l n="173">Now , now we feel the holy mystery</l>

     <l n="176">Where'er I look , I am alone in God ,</l>

     <l n="84">From striking on it . The door closed behind .</l>
     <l n="85">And then I saw that there was something black ,</l>
     <l n="86">Dark in the blackness of the night , heaved up</l>
     <l n="87">In the middle of the room . And then I saw</l>
     <l n="88">That there were shapes of woe all round the room ,</l>
     <l n="89">Like women in long mantles , bent in grief ,</l>
     <l n="90">With long veils hanging low down from their heads ,</l>
     <l n="91">All blacker in the darkness . Not a sound</l>
     <l n="92">Broke the death-stillness . Then the shapeless thing</l>
     <l n="93">Began to move . Four horrid muffled figures</l>
     <l n="94">Had lifted , bore it from the room . We followed ,</l>
     <l n="95">The bending woman-shapes , and I . We left</l>
     <l n="96">The house in long procession . I was walking</l>
     <l n="97">Alone beside the coffin — such it was —</l>
     <l n="98">Now in the glimmering light I saw the thing .</l>
     <l n="99">And now I saw and knew the woman-shapes :</l>
     <l n="100">Undine clothed in spray , and heaving up</l>
     <l n="101">White arms of lamentation ; Desdemona</l>
     <l n="102">In her night-robe , crimson on the left side ;</l>
     <l n="103">Thekla in black , with resolute white face ;</l>
     <l n="104">And Margaret in fetters , gliding slow —</l>
     <l n="105">That last look , when she shrieked on Henry , frozen</l>
     <l n="106">Upon her face . And many more I knew —</l>
     <l n="107">Long-suffering women , true in heart and life ;</l>
     <l n="108">Women that make man proud for very love</l>
     <l n="109">Of their humility , and of his pride</l>
     <l n="110">Ashamed . And in the coffin lay my wife .</l>
     <l n="111">On , on , we went . The scene changed , and low hills</l>
     <l n="112">Began to rise on each side of the path</l>
     <l n="113">Until at last we came into a glen ,</l>
     <l n="114">From which the mountains soared abrupt to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="115">Shot cones and pinnacles into the skies .</l>
     <l n="116">Upon the eastern side one mighty summit</l>
     <l n="117">Shone with its snow faint through the dusky air ;</l>
     <l n="118">And on its sides the glaciers gave a tint ,</l>
     <l n="119">A dull metallic gleam , to the slow night .</l>
     <l n="120">From base to top , on climbing peak and crag ,</l>
     <l n="121">Ay , on the glaciers ’ breast , were human shapes ,</l>
     <l n="122">Motionless , waiting ; men that trod the earth</l>
     <l n="123">Like gods ; or forms ideal that inspired</l>
     <l n="124">Great men of old — up , even to the apex</l>
     <l n="125">Of the snow-spear-point . Morning had arisen</l>
     <l n="126">From Giulian 's tomb in Florence , where the chisel</l>
     <l n="127">Of Michelangelo laid him reclining ,</l>
     <l n="128">And stood upon the crest .</l>
     <l n="129">A cry awoke</l>
     <l n="130">Amid the watchers at the lowest base ,</l>
     <l n="131">And swelling rose , and sprang from mouth to mouth ,</l>
     <l n="132">Up the vast mountain , to its aerial top ;</l>
     <l n="133">And “ Is God coming ? ” was the cry ; which died</l>
     <l n="134">Away in silence ; for no voice said No .</l>
     <l n="135">The bearers stood and set the coffin down ;</l>
     <l n="136">The mourners gathered round it in a group ;</l>
     <l n="137">Somewhat apart I stood , I know not why .</l>
     <l n="138">So minutes passed . Again that cry awoke ,</l>
     <l n="139">And clomb the mountain-side , and died away</l>

     <l n="1">Proudly the youth , sudden with manhood crowned ,</l>
     <l n="2">Went walking by his horses , the first time ,</l>
     <l n="3">That morning , to the plough . No soldier gay</l>
     <l n="4">Feels at his side the throb of the gold hilt</l>
     <l n="5">( Knowing the blue blade hides within its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="6">As lightning in the cloud ) with more delight ,</l>
     <l n="7">When first he belts it on , than he that day</l>
     <l n="8">Heard still the clank of the plough-chains against</l>
     <l n="9">His horses ’ harnessed sides , as to the field</l>
     <l n="10">They went to make it fruitful . O'er the hill</l>
     <l n="11">The sun looked down , baptizing him for toil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">A farmer 's son , a farmer 's grandson he ;</l>
     <l n="13">Yea , his great-grandsire had possessed those fields .</l>
     <l n="14">Tradition said they had been tilled by men</l>
     <l n="15">Who bore the name long centuries ago ,</l>
     <l n="16">And married wives , and reared a stalwart race ,</l>
     <l n="17">And died , and went where all had followed them ,</l>
     <l n="18">Save one old man , his daughter , and the youth</l>
     <l n="19">Who ploughs in pride , nor ever doubts his toil ;</l>
     <l n="20">And death is far from him this sunny morn .</l>
     <l n="21">Why should we think of death when life is high ?</l>
     <l n="22">The earth laughs all the day , and sleeps all night .</l>
     <l n="23">The daylight 's labour and the night 's repose</l>

     <l n="25">The boy knew little ; but he read old tales</l>
     <l n="26">Of Scotland 's warriors , till his blood ran swift</l>
     <l n="27">As charging knights upon their death-career .</l>
     <l n="28">He chanted ancient tunes , till the wild blood</l>
     <l n="29">Was charmed back into its fountain-well ,</l>
     <l n="30">And tears arose instead . That poet 's songs ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whose music evermore recalls his name ,</l>
     <l n="32">His name of waters babbling as they run ,</l>
     <l n="33">Rose from him in the fields among the kine ,</l>
     <l n="34">And met the skylark 's , raining from the clouds .</l>
     <l n="35">But only as the poet-birds he sang —</l>
     <l n="36">From rooted impulse of essential song ;</l>
     <l n="37">The earth was fair — he knew not it was fair ;</l>
     <l n="38">His heart was glad — he knew not it was glad ;</l>
     <l n="39">He walked as in a twilight of the sense —</l>

     <l n="41">Long ere the sun had cleared the feathery tops</l>
     <l n="42">Of the fir-thicket on the eastward hill ,</l>
     <l n="43">His horses leaned and laboured . Each great hand</l>
     <l n="44">Held rein and plough-stilt in one guiding grasp —</l>
     <l n="45">No ploughman there would brook a helper . Proud</l>
     <l n="46">With a true ploughman 's pride — nobler , I think ,</l>
     <l n="47">Than statesman 's , ay , or poet 's , or painter 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="48">For little praise will come that he ploughs well —</l>
     <l n="49">He did plough well , proud of his work itself ,</l>
     <l n="50">And not of what would follow . With sure eye ,</l>
     <l n="51">He saw his horses keep the arrow-track ;</l>
     <l n="52">He saw the swift share cut the measured sod ;</l>
     <l n="53">He saw the furrow folding to the right ,</l>
     <l n="54">Ready with nimble foot to aid at need :—</l>
     <l n="55">Turning its secrets upward to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="56">And hiding in the dark the sun-born grass ,</l>
     <l n="57">And daisies dipped in carmine , lay the tilth —</l>
     <l n="58">A million graves to nurse the buried seed ,</l>

     <l n="60">When the steep sun had clomb to his decline ,</l>
     <l n="61">And pausing seemed , at edge of slow descent ,</l>
     <l n="62">Upon the keystone of his airy bridge ,</l>
     <l n="63">They rested likewise , half-tired man and horse ,</l>
     <l n="64">And homeward went for food and courage new .</l>
     <l n="65">Therewith refreshed , they turned again to toil ,</l>
     <l n="66">And lived in labour all the afternoon ;</l>
     <l n="67">Till , in the gloaming , once again the plough</l>
     <l n="68">Lay like a stranded bark upon the lea ,</l>
     <l n="69">And home with hanging neck the horses went ,</l>
     <l n="70">Walking beside their master , force by will :</l>
     <l n="71">Then through the lengthening shades a vision came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="72">It was a lady mounted on a horse ,</l>
     <l n="73">A slender girl upon a mighty steed ,</l>
     <l n="74">That bore her with the pride horses must feel</l>
     <l n="75">When they submit to women . Home she went ,</l>
     <l n="76">Alone , or else her groom lagged far behind .</l>
     <l n="77">Scarce had she bent simple acknowledgment</l>
     <l n="78">Of the hand in silent salutation lifted</l>
     <l n="79">To the bowed head , when something faithless yielded :</l>
     <l n="80">The saddle slipped , the horse stopped , and the girl</l>
     <l n="81">Stood on her feet , still holding fast the reins .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="82">Three paces bore him bounding to her side ;</l>
     <l n="83">Her radiant beauty almost fixed him there ;</l>
     <l n="84">But with main force , as one that grapples fear ,</l>
     <l n="85">He threw the fascination off , and saw</l>
     <l n="86">The work before him . Soon his hand and knife</l>
     <l n="87">Had set the saddle firmer than before</l>
     <l n="88">Upon the gentle horse ; and then he turned</l>
     <l n="89">To mount the maiden . But bewilderment</l>
     <l n="90">A moment lasted ; for he knew not how ,</l>
     <l n="91">With stirrup-hand and steady arm , to throne ,</l>
     <l n="92">Elastic , on her steed , the ascending maid :</l>
     <l n="93">A moment only ; for while yet she thanked ,</l>
     <l n="94">Nor yet had time to teach her further will ,</l>
     <l n="95">About her waist he put his brawny hands ,</l>
     <l n="96">That all but zoned her round ; and like a child</l>
     <l n="97">Lifting her high , he set her on the horse ;</l>
     <l n="98">Whence like a risen moon she smiled on him ,</l>
     <l n="99">Nor turned aside , although a radiant blush</l>
     <l n="100">Shone in her cheek , and shadowed in her eyes .</l>
     <l n="101">And he was never sure if from her heart</l>
     <l n="102">Or from the rosy sunset came the flush .</l>
     <l n="103">Again she thanked him , while again he stood</l>
     <l n="104">Bewildered in her beauty . Not a word</l>
     <l n="105">Answered her words that flowed , folded in tones</l>
     <l n="106">Round which dissolving lambent music played ,</l>
     <l n="107">Like dropping water in a silver cup ;</l>
     <l n="108">Till , round the shoulder of the neighbouring hill ,</l>
     <l n="109">Sudden she disappeared . And he awoke ,</l>
     <l n="110">And called himself hard names , and turned and went</l>
     <l n="111">After his horses , bending like them his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="112">Ah God ! when Beauty passes from the door ,</l>

     <l n="122">Nor think the airy castles of his brain</l>
     <l n="123">Had less foundation than the air admits .</l>

     <l n="4">But withered to a ghost-like stealthy gleam ,</l>
     <l n="5">Round the horizon creeps the short-lived night ,</l>
     <l n="6">And changes into sunrise in a swoon .</l>

     <l n="43">By the glad sense of freedom and like thoughts ;</l>
     <l n="44">And by the bond of friendship with the dead ,</l>
     <l n="45">She told the tale which here I tell again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="46">I had returned to childish olden time ,</l>
     <l n="47">And asked her if she knew a castle worn ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whose masonry , razed utterly above ,</l>
     <l n="49">Yet faced the sea-cliff up , and met the waves :—</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Twas one of my child-marvels ; for , each year ,</l>
     <l n="51">We turned our backs upon the ripening corn ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sought some village on the Moray shore ;</l>
     <l n="53">And nigh this ruin , was that I loved the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="54">For oh the riches of that little port !—</l>
     <l n="55">Down almost to the beach , where a high wall</l>
     <l n="56">Inclosed them , came the gardens of a lord ,</l>
     <l n="57">Free to the visitor with foot restrained —</l>
     <l n="58">His shady walks , his ancient trees of state ;</l>
     <l n="59">His river — that would not be shut within ,</l>
     <l n="60">But came abroad , went dreaming o'er the sands ,</l>
     <l n="61">And lost itself in finding out the sea ;</l>
     <l n="62">Inside , it bore grave swans , white splendours — crept</l>
     <l n="63">Under the fairy leap of a wire bridge ,</l>
     <l n="64">Vanished in leaves , and came again where lawns</l>
     <l n="65">Lay verdurous , and the peacock 's plumy heaven</l>
     <l n="66">Bore azure suns with green and golden rays .</l>
     <l n="67">It was my childish Eden ; for the skies</l>
     <l n="68">Were loftier in that garden , and the clouds</l>
     <l n="69">More summer-gracious , edged with broader white ;</l>
     <l n="70">And when they rained , it was a golden rain</l>
     <l n="71">That sparkled as it fell — an odorous rain .</l>
     <l n="72">And then its wonder-heart !— a little room ,</l>
     <l n="73">Half-hollowed in the side of a steep hill ,</l>
     <l n="74">Which rose , with columned , windy temple crowned ,</l>
     <l n="75">A landmark to far seas . The enchanted cell</l>
     <l n="76">Was clouded over in the gentle night</l>
     <l n="77">Of a luxuriant foliage , and its door ,</l>
     <l n="78">Half-filled with rainbow hues of coloured glass ,</l>
     <l n="79">Opened into the bosom of the hill .</l>
     <l n="80">Never to sesame of mine that door</l>
     <l n="81">Gave up its sanctuary ; but through the glass ,</l>
     <l n="82">Gazing with reverent curiosity ,</l>
     <l n="83">I saw a little chamber , round and high ,</l>
     <l n="84">Which but to see was to escape the heat ,</l>
     <l n="85">And bathe in coolness of the eye and brain ;</l>
     <l n="86">For all was dusky greenness ; on one side ,</l>
     <l n="87">A window , half-blind with ivy manifold ,</l>
     <l n="88">Whose leaves , like heads of gazers , climbed to the top ,</l>
     <l n="89">Gave a joy-saddened light , for all that came</l>
     <l n="90">Through the thick veil was green , oh , kindest hue !</l>
     <l n="91">But the heart has a heart — this heart had one :</l>
     <l n="92">Still in the midst , the ever more of all ,</l>
     <l n="93">On a low column stood , white , cold , dim-clear ,</l>
     <l n="94">A marble woman . Who she was I know not —</l>
     <l n="95">A Psyche , or a Silence , or an Echo :</l>
     <l n="96">Pale , undefined , a silvery shadow , still ,</l>
     <l n="97">In one lone chamber of my memory ,</l>
     <l n="98">She is a power upon me as of old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="99">But , ah , to dream there through hot summer days ,</l>
     <l n="100">In coolness shrouded and sea-murmurings ,</l>
     <l n="101">Forgot by all till twilight shades grew dark !</l>
     <l n="102">To find half-hidden in the hollowed wall ,</l>
     <l n="103">A nest of tales , old volumes such as dreams</l>
     <l n="104">Hoard up in bookshops dim in tortuous streets !</l>
     <l n="105">That wondrous marble woman evermore</l>
     <l n="106">Filling the gloom with calm delirium</l>
     <l n="107">Of radiated whiteness , as I read !—</l>
     <l n="108">The fancied joy , too plenteous for its cup ,</l>
     <l n="109">O'erflowed , and turned to sadness as it fell .</l>

     <l n="119">Whence through a small square window I looked forth</l>
     <l n="120">Wide o'er the waters ; the dim-sounding waves</l>
     <l n="121">Were many feet below , and shrunk in size</l>
     <l n="122">To a great ripple . ” “ ‘ Twas not there , ” she said ,</l>

     <l n="126">‘ Tis more an ocean-cave than castle-vault . ”</l>
     <l n="127">And then she told me all she knew of her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="128">It was a simple tale , a monotone :</l>
     <l n="129">She climbed one sunny hill , gazed once abroad ,</l>
     <l n="130">Then wandered down , to pace a dreary plain ;</l>
     <l n="131">Alas ! how many such are told by night ,</l>
     <l n="132">In fisher-cottages along the shore !</l>

     <l n="133">Farewell , old summer-day ! I turn aside</l>
     <l n="134">To tell her story , interwoven with thoughts</l>

     <l n="2">Swelling great sails , and bending lordly masts ,</l>

     <l n="5">Now , like a white cloud o'er another sky ,</l>
     <l n="6">It blows a tall brig from the harbour 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="7">Away to high-tossed heads of wallowing waves ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Mid hoverings of long-pinioned arrowy birds .</l>
     <l n="9">With clouds and birds and sails and broken crests ,</l>
     <l n="10">All space is full of spots of fluttering white ,</l>
     <l n="11">And yet the sailor knows that handkerchief</l>

     <l n="13">Blow , wind ! draw out the cord that binds the twain ;</l>

     <l n="18">And linger ghost-like o'er the vanished hull ,</l>
     <l n="19">With a white farewell to her straining eyes ;</l>
     <l n="20">For never more in morning 's level beams ,</l>
     <l n="21">Will those sea-shadowing sails , dark-stained and worn ,</l>
     <l n="22">From the gray-billowed north come dancing in ;</l>

     <l n="24">Over the dusk of the dim-glancing sea ,</l>
     <l n="25">Will the great ship send forth a herald cry</l>

     <l n="44">Slow climbing up the round side of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="45">Haply her prayers were drawing his tardy sails</l>
     <l n="46">Over the threshold of the far sky-sea —</l>
     <l n="47">Drawing her sailor home to celebrate ,</l>

     <l n="53">And growing in bulk , possessed her atmosphere ,</l>
     <l n="54">And lost all shape , because it filled all space ,</l>

     <l n="56">In sudden incarnations darting swift</l>

     <l n="118">To the last lonely point where the green mass</l>

     <l n="2">Great Rome from tyrants , for the season brief</l>
     <l n="3">That lay ‘ twixt him and battle , sought relief</l>
     <l n="4">From painful thoughts , he in a book did read ,</l>
     <l n="5">That so the death of Portia might not breed</l>
     <l n="6">Unmanful thoughts , and cloud his mind with grief :</l>
     <l n="7">Brother of Brutus , of high hearts the chief ,</l>
     <l n="8">When thou at length receiv'st thy heavenly meed ,</l>
     <l n="9">And I have found my hoping not in vain ,</l>
     <l n="10">Tell me my book has wiled away one pang</l>
     <l n="11">That out of some lone sacred memory sprang ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or wrought an hour 's forgetfulness of pain ,</l>
     <l n="13">And I shall rise , my heart brimful of gain ,</l>
     <l n="14">And thank my God amid the golden clang .</l>

     <l n="1">They say that lonely sorrows do not chance :</l>
     <l n="2">More gently , I think , sorrows together go ;</l>
     <l n="3">A new one joins the funeral gliding slow</l>
     <l n="4">With less of jar than when it breaks the dance .</l>
     <l n="5">Grief swages grief , and joy doth joy enhance ;</l>
     <l n="6">Nature is generous to her children so .</l>
     <l n="7">And were they quick to spy the flowers that blow ,</l>
     <l n="8">As quick to feel the sharp-edged stones that lance</l>
     <l n="9">The foot that must walk naked in life 's way ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Blest by the roadside lily , free from fear ,</l>
     <l n="11">Oftener than hurt by dash of flinty spear ,</l>
     <l n="12">They would walk upright , bold , and earnest-gay ;</l>
     <l n="13">And when the soft night closed the weary day ,</l>
     <l n="14">Would sleep like those that far-off music hear .</l>

     <l n="4">Few are left like thee — few , I say , not none ,</l>

     <l n="9">The smile that gracious broke on thy grand face</l>

     <l n="1">I walked all night : the darkness did not yield .</l>
     <l n="2">Around me fell a mist , a weary rain ,</l>
     <l n="3">Enduring long . At length the dawn revealed</l>

     <l n="4">A temple 's front , high-lifted from the plain .</l>
     <l n="5">Closed were the lofty doors that led within ;</l>

     <l n="7">‘ Twas awe and silence when I entered in ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Sweet sound of voices low , together tossed ,</l>
     <l n="11">As if they sought some harmony to find</l>

     <l n="4">And spreads diluted in the cloud , and sinks ,</l>

     <l n="10">Until the city tremble . The clamour of bells ,</l>
     <l n="11">Importunate , keeps calling pale-faced forms</l>
     <l n="12">To gather and feed those Samsons ’ groaning strength</l>
     <l n="13">With labour ; and among the many come</l>

     <l n="85">Widening to larger glimmers of growing green .</l>
     <l n="86">Oh , far away the streets repel the spring !</l>
