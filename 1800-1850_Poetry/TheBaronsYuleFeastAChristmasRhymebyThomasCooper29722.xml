    <head>TO</head>
    <head>THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON .</head>
     <l n="1">Lady , receive a tributary lay</l>
     <l n="2">From one who cringeth not to titled state</l>
     <l n="3">Conventional , and lacketh will to prate</l>
     <l n="4">Of comeliness — though thine , to which did pay</l>
     <l n="5">The haughty Childe his tuneful homage , may</l>
     <l n="6">No minstrel deem a harp-theme derogate .</l>
     <l n="7">I reckon thee among the truly great</l>
     <l n="8">And fair , because with genius thou dost sway</l>
     <l n="9">The thought of thousands , while thy noble heart</l>
     <l n="10">With pity glows for Suffering , and with zeal</l>
     <l n="11">Cordial relief and solace to impart .</l>
     <l n="12">Thou didst , while I rehearsed Toil 's wrongs , reveal</l>
     <l n="13">Such yearnings ! Plead ! let England hear thee plead</l>
     <l n="14">With eloquent tongue ,— that Toil from wrong be freed !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>Several pieces in the following Rhyme were written many years ago , and will be recognised by my early friends . They were the fruit of impressions derived from the local associations of boyhood , ( of which , the reader , if inclined , may learn more in the notes ,) and of an admiration created by the exquisite beauty and simplicity of Coleridge 's ‘ Christabel , ’ — which I had by heart , and used to repeat to Thomas Miller , my playmate and companion from infancy , during many a delightful ‘ Day in the Woods , ’ and pleasing ramble on the hills and in the woods above Gainsborough , and along the banks of Trent .</p>
   <p>I offer but one apology for the production of a metrical essay , composed chiefly of imperfect and immature pieces :— the ambition to contribute towards the fund of Christmas entertainment , in which agreeable labour I see many popular names engaged ,— and among them , one , the most deservedly popular in the literature of the day . The favour with which an influential portion of the press has received my ‘ Prison Rhyme ’ emboldens me to take this step ; and if the flagellation of criticism be not too keenly dealt upon me for the imperfections in the few pages that follow , I will be content , in this instance , to expect no praise .</p>

     <l n="1">Right beautiful is Torksey 's hall ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">Adown by meadowed Trent ;</l>
     <l n="3">Right beautiful that mouldering wall ,</l>
     <l n="4">And remnant of a turret tall ,</l>
     <l n="5">Shorn of its battlement .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">For , while the children of the Spring</l>
     <l n="7">Blush into life , and die ;</l>
     <l n="8">And Summer 's joy-birds take light wing</l>
     <l n="9">When Autumn mists are nigh ;</l>
     <l n="10">And soon the year — a winterling —</l>
     <l n="11">With its fall'n leaves doth lie ;</l>
     <l n="12">That ruin gray —</l>
     <l n="13">Mirror 'd , alway ,</l>
     <l n="14">Deep in the silver stream ,</l>
     <l n="15">Doth summon weird-wrought visions vast ,</l>
     <l n="16">That show the actors of the past</l>
     <l n="17">Pictured , as in a dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">Meseemeth , now , before mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="19">The pomp-clad phantoms dimly rise ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till the full pageant bright —</l>
     <l n="21">A throng of warrior-barons bold ,</l>
     <l n="22">Glittering in burnished steel and gold ,</l>
     <l n="23">Bursts on my glowing sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">And , mingles with the martial train ,</l>
     <l n="25">Full many a fair-tressed beauty vain ,</l>
     <l n="26">On palfrey and jennet —</l>
     <l n="27">That proudly toss the tasselled rein ,</l>
     <l n="28">And daintily curvet ;</l>
     <l n="29">And war-steeds prance ,</l>
     <l n="30">And rich plumes glance</l>
     <l n="31">On helm and burgonet ;</l>
     <l n="32">And lances crash ,</l>
     <l n="33">And falchions flash</l>
     <l n="34">Of knights in tourney met .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">Fast fades the joust !— and fierce forms frown</l>
     <l n="36">That man the leaguered tower ,—</l>
     <l n="37">Nor quail to scan the kingly crown</l>
     <l n="38">That leads the leaguering power .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">Trumpet and “ rescue ” ring !— and , soon ,</l>
     <l n="40">He who began the strife</l>
     <l n="41">Is fain to crave one paltry boon :—</l>
     <l n="42">The thrall-king begs his life !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">Our fathers and their throbbing toil</l>
     <l n="44">Are hushed in pulseless death ;</l>
     <l n="45">Hushed is the dire and deadly broil —</l>
     <l n="46">The tempest of their wrath ;—</l>
     <l n="47">Yet , of their deeds not all for spoil</l>
     <l n="48">Is thine , O sateless Grave !</l>
     <l n="49">Songs of their brother-hours shall foil</l>
     <l n="50">Thy triumph o'er the brave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="51">Their bravery take , and darkly hide</l>
     <l n="52">Deep in thy inmost hold !</l>
     <l n="53">Take all their mailëd pomp and pride</l>
     <l n="54">To deck thy mansions cold !</l>
     <l n="55">Plunderer ! thou hast but purified</l>
     <l n="56">Their memories from alloy :</l>
     <l n="57">Faults of the dead we scorn to chide —</l>
     <l n="58">Their virtues sing with joy .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="59">Lord of our fathers ’ ashes ! list</l>
     <l n="60">A carol of their mirth ;</l>
     <l n="61">Nor shake thy nieve , chill moralist !</l>
     <l n="62">To check their sons ’ joy-birth :—</l>

     <l n="63">It is the season when our sires</l>

     <l n="66">Old Yule shall have a lay :—</l>
     <l n="67">A prison-bard is once more free ;</l>
     <l n="68">And , ere he yields his voice to thee ,</l>
     <l n="69">His song a merry-song shall be !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="70">Sir Wilfrid de Thorold<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>freely holds</l>
     <l n="71">What his stout sires held before —</l>
     <l n="72">Broad lands for plough , and fruitful folds ,—</l>
     <l n="73">Though by gold he sets no store ;</l>
     <l n="74">And he saith , from fen and woodland wolds ,</l>
     <l n="75">From marish , heath , and moor ,—</l>
     <l n="76">To feast in his hall ,</l>
     <l n="77">Both free and thrall ,</l>
     <l n="78">Shall come as they came of yore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="79">“ Let the merry bells ring out ! ” saith he</l>
     <l n="80">To my lady of the Fosse ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="81">“ We will keep the birth-eve joyfully</l>

     <l n="85">“ Bid thy losel monks that patter of faith</l>
     <l n="86">Shew works , and never tire . ”</l>
     <l n="87">Saith the lord of saint Leonard 's : “ The brotherhood</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="91">Then , turning to his daughter fair ,</l>
     <l n="92">Who leaned on her father 's carven chair ,—</l>

     <l n="94">On his peerless child ,—</l>
     <l n="95">His jewel whose price no clerk could tell ,</l>
     <l n="96">Though the clerk had told</l>
     <l n="97">Sea sands for gold ;—</l>
     <l n="98">For her dear mother 's sake he loved her well ,—</l>
     <l n="99">But more for the balm her tenderness</l>
     <l n="100">Had poured on his widowed heart 's distress ;—</l>
     <l n="101">More , still more , for her own heart 's grace</l>
     <l n="102">That so lovelily shone in her lovely face ,</l>
     <l n="103">And drew all eyes its love to trace —</l>
     <l n="104">Left all tongues languageless !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="105">He said ,— and smiled</l>

     <l n="107">“ Sweet bird ! bid Hugh our seneschal</l>
     <l n="108">Send to saint Leonard 's , ere even-fall ,</l>
     <l n="109">A fat fed beeve , and a two-shear sheep ,</l>
     <l n="110">With a firkin of ale that a monk in his sleep</l>

     <l n="112">And wake up and swig , without reproach !—</l>
     <l n="113">And the nuns of the Fosse — for wassail-bread —</l>
     <l n="114">Let them have wheat , both white and red ;</l>
     <l n="115">And a runlet of mead , with a jug of the wine</l>
     <l n="116">Which the merchant-man vowed he brought from the Rhine ;</l>
     <l n="117">And bid Hugh say that their bells must ring</l>
     <l n="118">A peal loud and long ,</l>
     <l n="119">While we chaunt heart-song ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="121">Now merrily ring the lady-bells</l>
     <l n="122">Of the nunnery by the Fosse :—</l>
     <l n="123">Say the hinds , “ Their silver music swells</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="126">And solemnly swells saint Leonard 's chime</l>
     <l n="127">And the great bell loud and deep :—</l>
     <l n="128">Say the gossips , “ Let 's talk of the holy time</l>
     <l n="129">When the shepherds watched their sheep ;</l>
     <l n="130">And the Babe was born for all souls ’ crime</l>

     <l n="132">But , anon , shrills the pipe of the merry mime ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="134">“ God save your souls , good Christian folk !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="138">Then , plough-boy Jack , in kirtle gay ,—</l>
     <l n="139">Though shod with clouted shoon ,—</l>
     <l n="140">Stands forth the wilful maid to play</l>
     <l n="141">Who ever saith to her lover “ Nay ” —</l>
     <l n="142">When he sues for a lover 's boon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="143">While Hob the smith with sturdy arm</l>

     <l n="146">Busseth his lips , like a lover warm ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="148">Then loffe the gossips , as if wit</l>

     <l n="151">Natheless , their memories acquit</l>

     <l n="153">No harmful thoughts their revels blight ,—</l>

    <p n="2">TORKSEY 'S HALL .</p>
    <p n="3">The remains of this ancient erection ( of which a representation is given in the accompanying vignette ) form an interesting antiquarian object beside the Trent , twelve miles from Lincoln , and seven from Gainsborough . The entire absence of any authentic record , as to the date of the foundation , or its former possessors , leaves the imagination at full liberty to clothe it with poetic legend . Visits made to it , in my childhood , and the hearing of wild narratives respecting the treasures buried beneath its ruins , and the power of its lords in the times of chivalry , fixed it , very early , in my mind , as the fit site for a tale of romance . In addition to the beautiful fragment of a front on the Trent bank , massive and extensive foundations in the back-ground show that it must have been an important building in by-gone times .</p>
    <p n="4">Torksey was , undoubtedly , one of the first towns in Lincolnshire , in the Saxon period . Only three of the towns in the county are classed in Domesday Book , and it is one of them : “ Lincoln mans . 982 ; Stamford 317 : Terchesey 102 . ” ( Turner 's Hist . of the Anglo-Saxons , 1836 , vol . iii . page 251 . ) Writers of parts of the county history ,— ( for a complete history of Lincolnshire has not yet been written ,) — affirm that Torksey is the Tiovulfingacester of Venerable Bede ; but Smith , the learned editor of the Cambridge edition of Bede , inclines to the opinion that Southwell is the town indicated by the pious and industrious monastic . The passage in Bede leaves every thing to conjecture : he simply relates that a truth-speaking presbyter and abbot of Pearteneu , ( most likely , Partney , near Horncastle , in Lincolnshire ,) named Deda , said that an old man had told him , that he , with a great multitude , was baptized by Paulinus , in the presence of King Edwin , “ in fluvio Treenta juxta civitatem quæ lingua Anglorum Tiovulfingacaestir vocatur ” — in the river Trent , near the city which in the language of the Angles is called Tiovulfingacaestir ( Smith 's Bede : Cambr . 1722 , page 97 . ) — This passage occurs immediately after the relation of the Christian mission of Paulinus into Lindsey , and his conversion of Blecca , governor of Lincoln , and his family , while the good King Edwin reigned over East Anglia , to which petty kingdom Lincolnshire seems sometimes to have belonged , though it was generally comprehended in the kingdom of Mercia , during the period of the Heptarchy .</p>
    <p n="5">If Stukeley be correct in his supposition that the “ Foss-dyke , ” or canal which connects the Trent here with the Witham at Lincoln , be the work of the Romans ,— and I know no reason for doubting it ,— Torksey , standing at the junction of the artificial river with the Trent , must have been an important station even before the Saxon times . These are Stukeley 's words relative to the commercial use of the Foss-Dyke : “ By this means the corn of Cambridgeshire , Bedfordshire , Huntingdonshire , Northamptonshire , Rutland , and Lincolnshire , came in ;— from the Trent , that of Nottinghamshire ; all easily conveyed northward to the utmost limits of the Roman power there , by the river Ouse , which is navigable to the imperial city of York . This city ( York ) was built and placed there , in that spot , on the very account of the corn-boats coming thither , and the emperors there resided , on that account ; and the great morass on the river Foss was the haven , or bason , where these corn-boats unladed . The very name of the Foss at York , and Foss-dyke between Lincoln and the Trent , are memorials of its being an artificial work , even as the great Foss road , equally the work of the spade , though in a different manner . ” ( Stukeley 's Palæographia Britannica : Stamford , 1746 : No . 2 , page 39 . )</p>
    <p n="6">In the superb edition of Dugdale 's Monasticon Anglicanum , edited by Sir Henry Ellis and others ( 1825 ) , occurs the following note , also evidencing the extent of ancient Torksey :— “ Mr. T. Sympson , who collected for a history of Lincoln , in a letter preserved in one of Cole 's manuscript volumes in the British Museum , dated January 20 , 1741 , says , ‘ Yesterday , in Atwater 's Memorandums , I met with a composition between the prior of St. Leonard 's in Torksey and the nuns of the Fosse , by which it appears there were then three parishes in Torksey : viz . All Saints , St. Mary 's , and St Peter 's . ” ( Vol . iv . page 292 . )</p>
    <p n="7">At what date this “ composition ” took place between the prior and nuns , we are not told : of course , it must have been before the dissolution of the religious houses . Leland 's account of Torksey , which is as follows , applies to a period immediately succeeding that event .</p>
    <p n="8">“ The olde buildinges of Torkesey wer on the south of the new toune , [ that is , at the junction of the Trent with the Fosse ] but ther now is litle seene of olde buildinges , more than a chapelle , wher men say was the paroch chirch of olde Torkesey ; and on Trent side the Yerth so balkith up that it shewith that there be likelihod hath beene sum waulle , and by it is a hill of yerth cast up : they caulle it the Wynde Mille Hille , but I thinke the dungeon of sum olde castelle was there .

    <p n="9">II .</p>
    <p n="10">THOROLD .</p>
    <p n="11">The high character for generousness and hospitality assigned to this most ancient of Lincolnshire families , by history and tradition , was my only reason for giving its name to an imaginary lord of Torksey . Ingulphus , the Croyland chronicler , in a passage full of grateful eloquence ,— ( commencing , “ Tunc inter familiares nostri monasterii , et benevolos amicos , erat præcipuus consiliarius quidam . Vicecomes Lincolniæ , dictus Thoroldus , ” — but too long to quote entire ,) — relates , that in a dreadful famine , which occurred in the reign of Edward the Confessor , Thorold , sheriff of Lincolnshire , gave his manor of Bokenhale to the abbey of Croyland , and afterwards bestowed upon it his manor of Spalding , with all its rents and profits . ( Gale 's Rer . Ang . Script . Vet . Tom . i. page 65 . Oxon , 1684 . )</p>
    <p n="12">Tanner thus briefly notices the latter circumstance : “ Spalding . Thorold de Bukenale , brother to the charitable countess Godiva , gave a place here , A. D. 1052 , for the habitation , and lands for the maintenance of a prior and five monks from Croiland . ” ( Notitia , page 251. fol . 1744 . ) The generosity of the female Thorold , Godiva , is matter of notoriety in the traditionary history of Coventry ; and her name , and that of her husband , are found in connection with the history of the very ancient town of Stow , in Lincolnshire , as benefactors to its church . “ Leofricus , comes Merciæ , et Godiva ejus uxor ecclesiam de S. Marie Stow , quam Eadnotus , episcopus Lincolniæ , construxit , pluribus ornamentis ditavit ” — Leofric , earl of Mercia , and Godiva his wife , enriched with many adornments the church of St. Mary at Stow , which Eadnoth , bishop of Lincoln , built . ( Leland 's Collectanea , vol . i. page 158 . London , 1770 . )</p>
    <p n="13">In Kimber and Johnson 's Baronetage ( vol . i. page 470 . ) the Thorold of the reign of Edward the Confessor is said to be descended from Thorold , sheriff of Lincolnshire in the reign of Kenelph , king of Mercia . Betham , in his “ Baronetage of England ” ( Ipswich , 1801 , vol . i. page 476 ) says the pedigree of the Thorolds is a “ very fine ” one , and enumerates its several branches of Marston , Blankney , Harmston , Morton , and Claythorp , and of the “ High Hall and Low Hall , in Hough , all within the said county of Lincoln . ” Betham , and other writers of his class , enumerate Thorolds , sheriffs of Lincolnshire , in the reigns of Philip and Mary , Elizabeth , James I. and Charles I .; and Sir George Thorold of Harmston was sheriff of London and Middlesex , in 1710 ,— and afterwards Lord Mayor .</p>
    <p n="14">Sir John Thorold of Syston is now the chief representative of this Saxon family ; but report says that he delights to live abroad — rather than in the midst of his tenantry and dependants , to gladden the hearts of the poor , and receive happiness from diffusing it among others , after the good example of his ancestors .</p>
    <p n="15">III .</p>
    <p n="16">FOSSE NUNNERY .</p>
    <p n="17">“ The Nunnery of the Fosse was begun by the inhabitants of Torksey upon some demesne lands belonging to the Crown , pretty early in King John 's time ; but King Henry III . confirming it , is said to have been the founder . The circumstance of the foundation by the men of Torksey is mentioned in King Henry 's charter . The Inspeximus of the 5th Edw . II ., which contains it , also contains a charter of King John , granting to the nuns two marks of silver which they had been used to pay annually into the Exchequer for the land at Torksey . In this charter King John calls them the Nuns of Torkesey . ” — Dugdale 's Monasticon , vol . iv . p. 292 .</p>
    <p n="18">IV .</p>
    <p n="19">SAINT LEONARD 'S .</p>
    <p n="20">Bishop Tanner , following Speed and Leland , says , “ Torkesey . On the east side of the new town stood a priory of Black Canons , built by K. John to the honour of St. Leonard . ” — Notitia , p. 278 . This priory was granted to Sir Philip Hobby , after the Dissolution : the Fosse Nunnery to Edward Lord Clinton .</p>
    <p n="21">V .</p>
    <p n="22">THORNEY WOOD .</p>
    <p n="23">In the neighbourhood of Torksey , and , traditionally , part of an extensive forest , in past times . A branch of the Nevils , claiming descent from the great earls of Warwick and Montagu , reside at Thorney .</p>
    <p n="24">VI .</p>
    <p n="25">GRUNSEL .</p>
    <p n="26">This old word for threshold is still common in Lincolnshire ; and with Milton 's meaning so plainly before his understanding ( Paradise Lost , book i. line 460 . ) , it is strange that Dr. Johnson should have given “ the lower part of the building ” as an explanation for grunsel . Lemon , in his “ Etymology , ” spells the word “ ground-sill , ” and then derives the last syllable from “ soil . ” Nothing can be more stupid . Door-sill is as common as grunsel , for threshold , in Staffordshire , as well as Lincolnshire ; and , in both counties , “ window-sill ” is frequent . I remember , too , in my boyhood , having heard the part of the plough to which the share is fitted — the frame of the harrows — and the frame of a grindstone , each called “ sill ” by the farmers of Lindsey .</p>
    <p n="27">VII .</p>
    <p n="28">ROMARA .</p>
    <p n="29">In this instance I have also used a name associated with the ancient history of Lincolnshire as an imaginary Norman lord of Torksey . “ William de Romara , lord of Bolingbroke , in Lincolnshire , was the first earl of that county after the Conquest . He was the son of Roger , son of Gerold de Romara ; which Roger married Lucia , daughter of Algar , earl of Chester , and sister and heir to Morcar , the Saxon earl of Northumberland and Lincoln . In 1142 he founded the Abbey of Revesby , in com . Linc ., bearing then the title of Earl of Lincoln . ” — BANKES ’ Extinct and Dormant Peerage .</p>
    <p n="30">VIII .</p>
    <p n="31">THE TRENT .</p>
    <p n="32">“ Or Trent , who like some earth-born giant spreads His thirty arms along the indented meads . ”</p>
    <p n="33">MILTON .</p>
    <p n="34">IX .</p>
    <p n="35">THE HEYGRE .</p>
    <p n="36">The tide , at the equinoxes especially , presents a magnificent spectacle on the Trent . It comes up even to Gainsborough , which is seventy miles from the sea , in one overwhelming wave , spreading across the wide river-channel , and frequently putting the sailors into some alarm for the safety of their vessels , which are dashed to and fro , while “ all hands ” are engaged in holding the cables and slackening them , so as to relieve the ships .</p>
    <p n="37">To be in a boat , under the guardianship of a sailor , and to hear the shouts on every hand of “ ‘ Ware Heygre ! ” — as the grand wave is beheld coming on ,— and then to be tossed up and down in the boat , as the wave is met ,— form no slight excitements for a boy living by the side of Trent .</p>
    <p n="38">I find no key to the derivation of the word Heygre in the Etymologists . The Keltic verb , Éigh , signifying , to cry , shout , sound , proclaim ; or the noun Eigin , signifying difficulty , distress , force , violence — may , perhaps , be the root from whence came this name for the tide — so dissimilar to any other English word of kindred meaning . It is scarcely probable that the word by which the earliest inhabitants of Britain would express their surprise at this striking phenomenon should ever be lost , or changed for another .</p>
    <p n="39">X .</p>
    <p n="40">THE PORPOISE .</p>
    <p n="41">The appearance of a porpoise , at the season when his favourite prey , the salmon , comes up the river to spawn , is another high excitement to dwellers on the Trent . I remember well the almost appalling interest with which , in childhood , I beheld some huge specimen of this marine visitor , drawn up by crane on a wharf , after an enthusiastic contest for his capture by the eager sailors .</p>
    <p n="42">XI .</p>
    <p n="43">AGNES PLANTAGENET .</p>
    <p n="44">The very interesting relic of the Old Hall at Gainsborough is associated , in the mind of one who spent more than half his existence in the old town , with much that is chivalrous . Mowbrays , Percys , De Burghs , and other high names of the feudal era are in the list of its possessors , as lords of the manor . None , however , of its former tenants calls up such stirring associations as ‘ Old John of Gaunt , time-honoured Lancaster , ’ who , with his earldom of Lincoln , held this castle and enlarged and beautified it . Tradition confidently affirms that his daughter was starved to death by him , in one of the rooms of the old tower ,— in consequence of her perverse attachment to her father 's foe ,— the knight of Torksey . Often have I heard the recital , from some aged gossip , by the fireside on a winter 's night ; and the rehearsal was invariably delivered with so much of solemn and serious averment — that the lady was still seen ,— that she would point out treasure , to any one who had the courage to speak to her ,— and that some families had been enriched by her ghostly means , though they had kept the secret ,— as to awaken within me no little dread of leaving the fireside for bed in the dark !</p>
    <p n="45">With indescribable feeling I wandered along the carven galleries and ruined rooms , or crept up the antique massive staircases , of this crumbling mansion of departed state , in my boyhood ,— deriving from these stolen visits to its interior , mingled with my admiring gaze at its battlemented turret , and rich octagonal window , ( which tradition said had lighted the chapel erected by John of Gaunt ,) a passion for chivalry and romance , that not even my Chartism can quench . Once , and once only , I remember creeping , under the guidance of an elder boy , up to the ‘ dark room ’ in the turret ; but the fear that we should really see the ghostly Lady caused us to run down the staircase , with beating hearts , as soon as we had reached the door and had had one momentary peep !</p>
    <p n="46">Other traditions of high interest are connected with this ancient mansion . One , says that Sweyn the Danish invader , ( the remains of whose camp exist at the distance of a mile from the town ,) was killed at a banquet , by his drunken nobles , in the field adjoining its precincts . Another , avers that in the Saxon building believed to have stood on the same spot , as the residence of the earls of Mercia , the glorious Alfred 's wedding-feast was held . Speed gives some little aid to the imagination in its credent regard for the story : “ Elswith , the wife of king Ælfred , was the daughter of Ethelfred , surnamed Muchel , that is , the Great , an Earle of the Mercians , who inhabited about Gainesborough , in Lincolnshire : her mother was Edburg , a lady borne of the Bloud roiall of Mercia . ” ( Historie of Great Britaine , 1632 : page 333 . )</p>
    <p n="47">XII .</p>
    <p n="48">ROCHE .</p>
    <p n="49">A visit to the beautiful ruins of Roche Abbey , near ancient Tickhill , and to the scenery amidst which they lie , created a youthful desire to depict them in verse . This doggrel ditty ( I forestall the critics ! ) of the Miller of Roche is all , however , that I preserved of the imperfect piece . The ditty is a homely versification of a homely tale which was often told by the fireside in Lincolnshire . I never saw anything resembling it in print , until Mr. Dickens ( whose kind attention I cannot help acknowledging ) pointed out to me a similar story in the Decameron .</p>
    <p n="50">Roche Abbey , according to the “ Monasticon Anglicanum , ” was founded by Richard de Builli and Richard Fitz-Turgis , in 1147 . “ The architecture bespeaks the time of Edward II . or III . ” ( Edit . 1825 : vol . v. p . 502 . )</p>
    <p n="51">XIII .</p>
    <p n="52">SCROGG AND CARR .</p>
    <p n="53">Johnson says , “ Scrog . A stunted shrub , bush , or branch ; yet used in some parts of the north . ” In Lincolnshire , however , the word is used to designate wild ground on which “ stunted shrub , bush , or branch ” grows , and not as a synonyme with shrub or bush .</p>
    <p n="54">Carr I have looked for in vain among the etymologists . Johnson merely quotes Gibson 's Camden to show that , in the names of places , Car “ seems to have relation to the British caer , a city ; ” and Junius , Skinner , Lemon , Horne Tooke , Jamieson , &amp; c. are silent about it . The word is applied , in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire , to the low lands , or wide marsh pastures that border the Trent ; and I feel little doubt that , like the word heygre , and many others that might be collected , it has been in use ever since it was given to these localities , by the primeval tribes , the Kelts , when they first saw these beautiful tracts , so much subject to inundation , like the flat borders of their own rivers in the East . = HEBREW = ( car ) a pasture , is found in Isaiah , xxx . 23 . Psalm lxv . 14 , &amp; c ., and although = HEBREW = ( kicar ) is simply translated “ plain ” in the established version , and Gesenius would , still more vaguely , render it “ circuit , surrounding country , ” ( from = HEBREW =, in Arabic , to be round ,) yet I suspect the words come from the same root , and have the same meaning . Thus , Genesis xiii . 10 . = HEBREW = might literally be rendered “ And Lot raised his eyes , and saw all the carr of the Jordan , that it was well watered everywhere , before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , like the garden of Jehovah ; like the land of Mitzraim , as thou approachest Zoar . ” How natural , that the Keltic or Kymric tribes should behold , in the Trent pastures , the resemblance of the plains on the banks of the Jordan , the Nile , the Tigris , and Euphrates — ( for the term = HEBREW = garden of Jehovah most probably denotes Mesopotamia , in the very ancient fragments collected by Moses to form the book of Genesis ) — and should denote them by the same name !</p>
    <p n="55">= ARABIC =, khaw [= a ] r , also signifies “ low or sloping ground , ” in Richardson 's Arabic and Persian Dictionary ; and “ Carr , a bog , a fen , or morass , ” occurs in Armstrong 's Gaelic Dictionary . The word I conceive is thus clearly traced to its Keltic or Eastern origin .</p>
    <p n="56">XIV .</p>
    <p n="57">CROWD .</p>
    <p n="58">Sir John Hawkins , in his highly curious “ History of Music ” ( vol . ii . page 274 ) says “ The Cruth or Crowth ” was an instrument “ formerly in common use in the principality of Wales , ” and is the “ prototype of the whole fidicinal species of musical instruments . ” “ It has six strings , supported by a bridge , and is played on by a bow . ” “ The word Cruth is pronounced in English Crowth , and corruptly Crowd . ” “ LÞuð is the Saxon appellation given by Leland , for the instrument ( Collectanea : vol . v .) ” “ A player on the cruth was called a Crowther or Crowder , and so also is a common fiddler to this day ; and hence , undoubtedly , Crowther , or Crowder , a common surname . Butler , with his usual humour , has characterised a common fiddler , and given him the name of Crowdero . ”</p>
    <p n="59">“ I'th ’ head of all this warlike rabble Crowdero marched , expert and able . ”</p>
    <p n="60">XV .</p>
    <p n="61">REBECK .</p>
    <p n="62">Rebeck is a word well known from Milton 's exquisite “ L'Allegro . ” Sir John Hawkins ( vol . ii . page 86 ) traces it to the Moorish Rebeb ; and believes he finds this old three-stringed fiddle in the hands of Chaucer 's Absolon , the parish-clerk , who could “ plaie songs on a smale ribible . ”</p>

    <p n="66">XVI .</p>
    <p n="67">THE SWINEHERD OF STOW .</p>
    <p n="68">St. Remigius , the Norman bishop , is placed on the pinnacle of one buttress that terminates the splendid façade , or west front of Lincoln Cathedral , and the Swineherd of Stow , with his horn in his hand , on the other . The tradition is in the mouth of every Lincolner , that this effigied honour was conferred on the generous rudester because he gave his horn filled with silver pennies towards the rebuilding or beautifying of the Minster .</p>
