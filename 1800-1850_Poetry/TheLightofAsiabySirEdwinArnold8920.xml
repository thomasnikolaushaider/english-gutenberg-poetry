   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Scripture of the Saviour of the World ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lord Buddha — Prince Siddartha styled on earth</l>
     <l n="3">In Earth and Heavens and Hells Incomparable ,</l>
     <l n="4">All-honoured , Wisest , Best , most Pitiful ;</l>
     <l n="5">The Teacher of Nirvana and the Law .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Then came he to be born again for men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Below the highest sphere four Regents sit</l>
     <l n="8">Who rule our world , and under them are zones</l>
     <l n="9">Nearer , but high , where saintliest spirits dead</l>
     <l n="10">Wait thrice ten thousand years , then live again ;</l>
     <l n="11">And on Lord Buddha , waiting in that sky ,</l>
     <l n="12">Came for our sakes the five sure signs of birth</l>
     <l n="13">So that the Devas knew the signs , and said</l>
     <l n="14">“ Buddha will go again to help the World . ”</l>
     <l n="15">“ Yea ! ” spake He , “ now I go to help the World .</l>
     <l n="16">This last of many times ; for birth and death</l>
     <l n="17">End hence for me and those who learn my Law .</l>
     <l n="18">I will go down among the Sakyas ,</l>
     <l n="19">Under the southward snows of Himalay ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where pious people live and a just King . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">That night the wife of King Suddhodana ,</l>
     <l n="22">Maya the Queen , asleep beside her Lord ,</l>
     <l n="23">Dreamed a strange dream ; dreamed that a star</l>
     <l n="24">from heaven —</l>
     <l n="25">Splendid , six-rayed , in colour rosy-pearl ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whereof the token was an Elephant</l>
     <l n="27">Six-tusked and whiter than Vahuka 's milk —</l>
     <l n="28">Shot through the void and , shining into her ,</l>
     <l n="29">Entered her womb upon the right . Awaked ,</l>
     <l n="30">Bliss beyond mortal mother 's filled her breast ,</l>
     <l n="31">And over half the earth a lovely light</l>
     <l n="32">Forewent the morn . The strong hills shook ; the waves</l>
     <l n="33">Sank lulled ; all flowers that blow by day came forth</l>
     <l n="34">As ‘ t were high noon ; down to the farthest hells</l>
     <l n="35">Passed the Queen 's joy , as when warm sunshine thrills</l>
     <l n="36">Wood-glooms to gold , and into all the deeps</l>
     <l n="37">A tender whisper pierced . “ Oh ye , ” it said ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ The dead that are to live , the live who die ,</l>
     <l n="39">Uprise , and hear , and hope ! Buddha is come ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">Whereat in Limbos numberless much peace</l>
     <l n="41">Spread , and the world 's heart throbbed , and a wind blew</l>
     <l n="42">With unknown freshness over lands and seas .</l>
     <l n="43">And when the morning dawned , and this was told ,</l>
     <l n="44">The grey dream-readers said “ The dream is good !</l>
     <l n="45">The Crab is in conjunction with the Sun ;</l>
     <l n="46">The Queen shall bear a boy , a holy child</l>
     <l n="47">Of wondrous wisdom , profiting all flesh ,</l>
     <l n="48">Who shall deliver men from ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or rule the world , if he will deign to rule . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="50">In this wise was the holy Buddha born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Queen Maya stood at noon , her days fulfilled ,</l>
     <l n="52">Under a Palsa in the Palace-grounds ,</l>
     <l n="53">A stately trunk , straight as a temple-shaft ,</l>
     <l n="54">With crown of glossy leaves and fragrant blooms ;</l>
     <l n="55">And , knowing the time some — for all things knew —</l>
     <l n="56">The conscious tree bent down its boughs to make</l>
     <l n="57">A bower above Queen Maya 's majesty ,</l>
     <l n="58">And Earth put forth a thousand sudden flowers</l>
     <l n="59">To spread a couch , while , ready for the bath ,</l>
     <l n="60">The rock hard by gave out a limpid stream</l>
     <l n="61">Of crystal flow . So brought she forth her child</l>
     <l n="62">Pangless — he having on his perfect form</l>
     <l n="63">The marks , thirty and two , of blessed birth ;</l>
     <l n="64">Of which the great news to the Palace came .</l>
     <l n="65">But when they brought the painted palanquin</l>
     <l n="66">To fetch him home , the bearers of the poles</l>
     <l n="67">Were the four Regents of the Earth , come down</l>
     <l n="68">From Mount Sumeru — they who write men 's deeds</l>
     <l n="69">On brazen plates — the Angel of the East ,</l>
     <l n="70">Whose hosts are clad in silver robes , and bear</l>
     <l n="71">Targets of pearl : the Angel of the South ,</l>
     <l n="72">Whose horsemen , the Kumbhandas , ride blue steeds ,</l>
     <l n="73">With sapphire shields : the Angel of the West ,</l>
     <l n="74">By Nagas followed , riding steeds blood-red ,</l>
     <l n="75">With coral shields : the Angel of the North ,</l>
     <l n="76">Environed by his Yakshas , all in gold ,</l>
     <l n="77">On yellow horses , bearing shields of gold .</l>
     <l n="78">These , with their pomp invisible , came down</l>
     <l n="79">And took the poles , in caste and outward garb</l>
     <l n="80">Like bearers , yet most mighty gods ; and gods</l>
     <l n="81">Walked free with men that day , though men knew not</l>
     <l n="82">For Heaven was filled with gladness for Earth 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="83">Knowing Lord Buddha thus was come again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="84">But King Suddhodana wist not of this ;</l>
     <l n="85">The portents troubled , till his dream-readers</l>
     <l n="86">Augured a Prince of earthly dominance ,</l>
     <l n="87">A Chakravartin , such as rise to rule</l>
     <l n="88">Once in each thousand years ; seven gifts he has</l>
     <l n="89">The Chakra-ratna , disc divine ; the gem ;</l>
     <l n="90">The horse , the Aswa-ratna , that proud steed</l>
     <l n="91">Which tramps the clouds ; a snow-white elephant ,</l>
     <l n="92">The Hasti-ratna , born to bear his King ;</l>
     <l n="93">The crafty Minister , the General</l>
     <l n="94">Unconquered , and the wife of peerless grace ,</l>
     <l n="95">The Istri-ratna , lovelier than the Dawn .</l>
     <l n="96">For which gifts looking with this wondrous boy ,</l>
     <l n="97">The King gave order that his town should keep</l>
     <l n="98">High festival ; therefore the ways were swept ,</l>
     <l n="99">Rose-odours sprinkled in the street , the trees</l>
     <l n="100">Were hung with lamps and flags , while merry crowds</l>
     <l n="101">Gaped on the sword-players and posturers ,</l>
     <l n="102">The jugglers , charmers , swingers , rope-walkers ,</l>
     <l n="103">The nautch-girls in their spangled skirts and bells</l>
     <l n="104">That chime light laughter round their restless feet ;</l>
     <l n="105">The masquers wrapped in skins of bear and deer .</l>
     <l n="106">The tiger-tamers , wrestlers , quail-fighters ,</l>
     <l n="107">Beaters of drum and twanglers of the wire ,</l>
     <l n="108">Who made the people happy by command .</l>
     <l n="109">Moreover from afar came merchant-men ,</l>
     <l n="110">Bringing , on tidings of this birth , rich gifts</l>
     <l n="111">In golden trays ; goat-shawls , and nard and jade ,</l>
     <l n="112">Turkises , “ evening-sky ” tint , woven webs —</l>
     <l n="113">So fine twelve folds hide not a modest face —</l>
     <l n="114">Waist-cloths sewn thick with pearls , and sandalwood ;</l>
     <l n="115">Homage from tribute cities ; so they called</l>
     <l n="116">Their Prince Svarthasiddh , “ All-Prospering , ”</l>
     <l n="117">Briefer , Siddartha .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="118">‘ Mongst the strangers came</l>
     <l n="119">A grey-haired saint , Asita , one whose ears ,</l>
     <l n="120">Long closed to earthly things , caught heavenly sounds ,</l>
     <l n="121">And heard at prayer beneath his peepul-tree</l>
     <l n="122">The Devas singing songs at Buddha 's birth .</l>
     <l n="123">Wondrous in lore he was by age and fasts ;</l>
     <l n="124">Him , drawing nigh , seeming so reverend ,</l>
     <l n="125">The King saluted , and Queen Maya made</l>
     <l n="126">To lay her babe before such holy feet ;</l>
     <l n="127">But when he saw the Prince the old man cried</l>
     <l n="128">“ Ah , Queen , not so ! ” and thereupon he touched</l>
     <l n="129">Eight times the dust , laid his waste visage there ,</l>
     <l n="130">Saying , “ O Babe ! I worship ! Thou art He !</l>
     <l n="131">I see the rosy light , the foot-sole marks ,</l>
     <l n="132">The soft curled tendril of the Swastika ,</l>
     <l n="133">The sacred primal signs thirty and two ,</l>
     <l n="134">The eighty lesser tokens . Thou art Buddh ,</l>
     <l n="135">And thou wilt preach the Law and save all flesh</l>
     <l n="136">Who learn the Law , though I shall never hear ,</l>
     <l n="137">Dying too soon , who lately longed to die ;</l>
     <l n="138">Howbeit I have seen Thee . Know , O King !</l>
     <l n="139">This is that Blossom on our human tree</l>
     <l n="140">Which opens once in many myriad years —</l>
     <l n="141">But opened , fills the world with Wisdom 's scent</l>
     <l n="142">And Love 's dropped honey ; from thy royal root</l>
     <l n="143">A Heavenly Lotus springs : Ah , happy House !</l>
     <l n="144">Yet not all-happy , for a sword must pierce</l>
     <l n="145">Thy bowels for this boy — whilst thou , sweet Queen !</l>
     <l n="146">Dear to all gods and men for this great birth ,</l>
     <l n="147">Henceforth art grown too sacred for more woe ,</l>
     <l n="148">And life is woe , therefore in seven days</l>
     <l n="149">Painless thou shalt attain the close of pain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="150">Which fell : for on the seventh evening</l>
     <l n="151">Queen Maya smiling slept , and waked no more ,</l>
     <l n="152">Passing content to Trayastrinshas-Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="153">Where countless Devas worship her and wait</l>
     <l n="154">Attendant on that radiant Motherhead .</l>
     <l n="155">But for the Babe they found a foster-nurse ,</l>
     <l n="156">Princess Mahaprajapati — her breast</l>
     <l n="157">Nourished with noble milk the lips of</l>
     <l n="158">Him Whose lips comfort the Worlds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="159">When th ’ eighth year passed</l>
     <l n="160">The careful King bethought to teach his son</l>
     <l n="161">All that a Prince should learn , for still he shunned</l>
     <l n="162">The too vast presage of those miracles ,</l>
     <l n="163">The glories and the sufferings of a Buddh .</l>
     <l n="164">So , in full council of his Ministers ,</l>
     <l n="165">“ Who is the wisest man , great sirs , ” he asked ,</l>
     <l n="166">“ To teach my Prince that which a Prince should know ? ”</l>
     <l n="167">Whereto gave answer each with instant voice</l>
     <l n="168">“ King ! Viswamitra is the wisest one ,</l>
     <l n="169">The farthest-seen in Scriptures , and the best</l>
     <l n="170">In learning , and the manual arts , and all . ”</l>
     <l n="171">Thus Viswamitra came and heard commands ;</l>
     <l n="172">And , on a day found fortunate , the Prince</l>
     <l n="173">Took up his slate of ox-red sandal-wood ,</l>
     <l n="174">All-beautified by gems around the rim ,</l>
     <l n="175">And sprinkled smooth with dust of emery ,</l>
     <l n="176">These took he , and his writing-stick , and stood</l>
     <l n="177">With eyes bent down before the Sage , who said ,</l>
     <l n="178">“ Child , write this Scripture , speaking slow the verse</l>
     <l n="179">‘ Gayatri ’ named , which only High-born hear :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="183">“ Acharya , I write , ” meekly replied</l>
     <l n="184">The Prince , and quickly on the dust he drew —</l>
     <l n="185">Not in one script , but many characters</l>
     <l n="186">The sacred verse ; Nagri and Dakshin , Ni ,</l>
     <l n="187">Mangal , Parusha , Yava , Tirthi , Uk ,</l>
     <l n="188">Darad , Sikhyani , Mana , Madhyachar ,</l>
     <l n="189">The pictured writings and the speech of signs ,</l>
     <l n="190">Tokens of cave-men and the sea-peoples ,</l>
     <l n="191">Of those who worship snakes beneath the earth ,</l>
     <l n="192">And those who flame adore and the sun 's orb ,</l>
     <l n="193">The Magians and the dwellers on the mounds ;</l>
     <l n="194">Of all the nations all strange scripts he traced</l>
     <l n="195">One after other with his writing-stick .</l>
     <l n="196">Reading the master 's verse in every tongue ;</l>
     <l n="197">And Viswamitra said , “ It is enough ,</l>
     <l n="198">Let us to numbers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="199">“ After me repeat</l>

     <l n="201">One , two , three , four , to ten , and then by tens</l>
     <l n="202">To hundreds , thousands . ” After him the child</l>
     <l n="203">Named digits , decads , centuries ; nor paused ,</l>
     <l n="204">The round Lakh reached , but softly murmured on</l>
     <l n="205">“ Then comes the koti , nahut , ninnahut ,</l>

     <l n="252">Art Guru . Oh , I worship thee , sweet Prince !</l>
     <l n="253">That comest to my school only to show</l>
     <l n="254">Thou knowest all without the books , and know'st</l>
     <l n="255">Fair reverence besides . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="256">Which reverence</l>
     <l n="257">Lord Buddha kept to all his schoolmasters ,</l>
     <l n="258">Albeit beyond their learning taught ; in speech</l>
     <l n="259">Right gentle , yet so wise ; princely of mien ,</l>
     <l n="260">Yet softly-mannered ; modest , deferent ,</l>
     <l n="261">And tender-hearted , though of fearless blood ;</l>
     <l n="262">No bolder horseman in the youthful band</l>
     <l n="263">E'er rode in gay chase of the shy gazelles ;</l>
     <l n="264">No keener driver of the chariot</l>
     <l n="265">In mimic contest scoured the Palace-courts ;</l>
     <l n="266">Yet in mid-play the boy would ofttimes pause ,</l>
     <l n="267">Letting the deer pass free ; would ofttimes yield</l>
     <l n="268">His half-won race because the labouring steeds</l>
     <l n="269">Fetched painful breath ; or if his princely mates</l>
     <l n="270">Saddened to lose , or if some wistful dream</l>
     <l n="271">Swept o'er his thoughts . And ever with the years</l>
     <l n="272">Waxed this compassionateness of our Lord ,</l>
     <l n="273">Even as a great tree grows from two soft leaves</l>
     <l n="274">To spread its shade afar ; but hardly yet</l>
     <l n="275">Knew the young child of sorrow , pain , or tears ,</l>
     <l n="276">Save as strange names for things not felt by kings ,</l>
     <l n="277">Nor ever to be felt . But it befell</l>
     <l n="278">In the Royal garden on a day of spring ,</l>
     <l n="279">A flock of wild swans passed , voyaging north</l>
     <l n="280">To their nest-places on Himala 's breast .</l>
     <l n="281">Calling in love-notes down their snowy line</l>
     <l n="282">The bright birds flew , by fond love piloted ;</l>
     <l n="283">And Devadatta , cousin of the Prince ,</l>
     <l n="284">Pointed his bow , and loosed a wilful shaft</l>
     <l n="285">Which found the wide wing of the foremost swan</l>
     <l n="286">Broad-spread to glide upon the free blue road ,</l>
     <l n="287">So that it fell , the bitter arrow fixed ,</l>
     <l n="288">Bright scarlet blood-gouts staining the pure plumes .</l>
     <l n="289">Which seeing , Prince Siddartha took the bird</l>
     <l n="290">Tenderly up , rested it in his lap</l>
     <l n="291">Sitting with knees crossed , as Lord Buddha sits</l>
     <l n="292">And , soothing with a touch the wild thing 's fright ,</l>
     <l n="293">Composed its ruffled vans , calmed its quick heart ,</l>
     <l n="294">Caressed it into peace with light kind palms</l>
     <l n="295">As soft as plantain-leaves an hour unrolled ;</l>
     <l n="296">And while the left hand held , the right hand drew</l>
     <l n="297">The cruel steel forth from the wound and laid</l>
     <l n="298">Cool leaves and healing honey on the smart .</l>
     <l n="299">Yet all so little knew the boy of pain</l>
     <l n="300">That curiously into his wrist he pressed</l>
     <l n="301">The arrow 's barb , and winced to feel it sting ,</l>
     <l n="302">And turned with tears to soothe his bird again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="303">Then some one came who said , “ My Prince hath shot</l>
     <l n="304">A swan , which fell among the roses here ,</l>
     <l n="305">He bids me pray you send it . Will you send ? ”</l>
     <l n="306">“ Nay , ” quoth Siddartha , “ if the bird were dead</l>
     <l n="307">To send it to the slayer might be well ,</l>
     <l n="308">But the swan lives ; my cousin hath but killed</l>
     <l n="309">The god-like speed which throbbed in this white wing . ”</l>
     <l n="310">And Devadatta answered , “ The wild thing ,</l>
     <l n="311">Living or dead , is his who fetched it down ;</l>
     <l n="312">‘ T was no man 's in the clouds , but fall'n ‘ t is mine ,</l>
     <l n="313">Give me my prize , fair Cousin . ” Then our Lord</l>
     <l n="314">Laid the swan 's neck beside his own smooth cheek</l>
     <l n="315">And gravely spake , “ Say no ! the bird is mine ,</l>
     <l n="316">The first of myriad things which shall be mine</l>
     <l n="317">By right of mercy and love 's lordliness .</l>
     <l n="318">For now I know , by what within me stirs ,</l>
     <l n="319">That I shall teach compassion unto men</l>
     <l n="320">And be a speechless world 's interpreter ,</l>
     <l n="321">Abating this accursed flood of woe ,</l>
     <l n="322">Not man 's alone ; but , if the Prince disputes ,</l>
     <l n="323">Let him submit this matter to the wise</l>
     <l n="324">And we will wait their word . ” So was it done ;</l>
     <l n="325">In full divan the business had debate ,</l>
     <l n="326">And many thought this thing and many that ,</l>
     <l n="327">Till there arose an unknown priest who said ,</l>
     <l n="328">“ If life be aught , the saviour of a life</l>
     <l n="329">Owns more the living thing than be can own</l>
     <l n="330">Who sought to slay — the slayer spoils and wastes ,</l>
     <l n="331">The cherisher sustains , give him the bird : ”</l>
     <l n="332">Which judgment all found just ; but when the King</l>
     <l n="333">Sought out the sage for honour , he was gone ;</l>
     <l n="334">And some one saw a hooded snake glide forth ,—</l>
     <l n="335">The gods come ofttimes thus ! So our Lord Buddh</l>
     <l n="336">Began his works of mercy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="337">Yet not more</l>
     <l n="338">Knew he as yet of grief than that one bird 's ,</l>
     <l n="339">Which , being healed , went joyous to its kind .</l>
     <l n="340">But on another day the King said , “ Come ,</l>
     <l n="341">Sweet son ! and see the pleasaunce of the spring ,</l>
     <l n="342">And how the fruitful earth is wooed to yield</l>
     <l n="343">Its riches to the reaper ; how my realm —</l>
     <l n="344">Which shall be thine when the pile flames for me —</l>
     <l n="345">Feeds all its mouths and keeps the King 's chest filled .</l>
     <l n="346">Fair is the season with new leaves , bright blooms ,</l>
     <l n="347">Green grass , and cries of plough-time . ” So they rode</l>
     <l n="348">Into a lane of wells and gardens , where ,</l>
     <l n="349">All up and down the rich red loam , the steers</l>
     <l n="350">Strained their strong shoulders in the creaking yoke</l>
     <l n="351">Dragging the ploughs ; the fat soil rose and rolled</l>
     <l n="352">In smooth dark waves back from the plough ; who drove</l>
     <l n="353">Planted both feet upon the leaping share</l>
     <l n="354">To make the furrow deep ; among the palms</l>
     <l n="355">The tinkle of the rippling water rang ,</l>
     <l n="356">And where it ran the glad earth ‘ broidered it</l>
     <l n="357">With balsams and the spears of lemon-grass .</l>
     <l n="358">Elsewhere were sowers who went forth to sow ;</l>
     <l n="359">And all the jungle laughed with nesting-songs ,</l>
     <l n="360">And all the thickets rustled with small life</l>
     <l n="361">Of lizard , bee , beetle , and creeping things</l>
     <l n="362">Pleased at the spring-time . In the mango-sprays</l>
     <l n="363">The sun-birds flashed ; alone at his green forge</l>
     <l n="364">Toiled the loud coppersmith ; bee-eaters hawked</l>
     <l n="365">Chasing the purple butterflies ; beneath ,</l>
     <l n="366">Striped squirrels raced , the mynas perked and picked ,</l>
     <l n="367">The nine brown sisters chattered in the thorn ,</l>
     <l n="368">The pied fish-tiger hung above the pool ,</l>
     <l n="369">The egrets stalked among the buffaloes ,</l>
     <l n="370">The kites sailed circles in the golden air ;</l>
     <l n="371">About the painted temple peacocks flew ,</l>
     <l n="372">The blue doves cooed from every well , far off</l>
     <l n="373">The village drums beat for some marriage-feast ;</l>
     <l n="374">All things spoke peace and plenty , and the Prince</l>
     <l n="375">Saw and rejoiced . But , looking deep , he saw</l>
     <l n="376">The thorns which grow upon this rose of life</l>
     <l n="377">How the sweat peasant sweated for his wage ,</l>
     <l n="378">Toiling for leave to live ; and how he urged</l>
     <l n="379">The great-eyed oxen through the flaming hours ,</l>
     <l n="380">Goading their velvet flanks : then marked he , too ,</l>
     <l n="381">How lizard fed on ant , and snake on him ,</l>
     <l n="382">And kite on both ; and how the fish-hawk robbed</l>
     <l n="383">The fish-tiger of that which it had seized ;</l>
     <l n="384">The shrike chasing the bulbul , which did chase</l>
     <l n="385">The jewelled butterflies ; till everywhere</l>
     <l n="386">Each slew a slayer and in turn was slain ,</l>
     <l n="387">Life living upon death . So the fair show</l>
     <l n="388">Veiled one vast , savage , grim conspiracy</l>
     <l n="389">Of mutual murder , from the worm to man ,</l>
     <l n="390">Who himself kills his fellow ; seeing which —</l>
     <l n="391">The hungry ploughman and his labouring kine ,</l>
     <l n="392">Their dewlaps blistered with the bitter yoke ,</l>
     <l n="393">The rage to live which makes all living strife —</l>
     <l n="394">The Prince Siddartha sighed . “ In this , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="395">“ That happy earth they brought me forth to see ?</l>
     <l n="396">How salt with sweat the peasant 's bread ! how hard</l>
     <l n="397">The oxen 's service ! in the brake how fierce</l>
     <l n="398">The war of weak and strong ! i ’ th ’ air what plots !</l>
     <l n="399">No refuge e'en in water . Go aside</l>
     <l n="400">A space , and let me muse on what ye show . ”</l>
     <l n="401">So saying , the good Lord Buddha seated him</l>
     <l n="402">Under a jambu-tree , with ankles crossed —</l>
     <l n="403">As holy statues sit — and first began</l>
     <l n="404">To meditate this deep disease of life ,</l>
     <l n="405">What its far source and whence its remedy .</l>
     <l n="406">So vast a pity filled him , such wide love</l>
     <l n="407">For living things , such passion to heal pain ,</l>
     <l n="408">That by their stress his princely spirit passed</l>
     <l n="409">To ecstasy , and , purged from mortal taint</l>
     <l n="410">Of sense and self , the boy attained thereat</l>
     <l n="411">Dhyana , first step of “ the path . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="412">There flew</l>
     <l n="413">High overhead that hour five holy ones ,</l>
     <l n="414">Whose free wings faltered as they passed the tree .</l>
     <l n="415">“ What power superior draws us from our flight ? ”</l>
     <l n="416">They asked , for spirits feel all force divine ,</l>
     <l n="417">And know the sacred presence of the pure .</l>
     <l n="418">Then , looking downward , they beheld the Buddh</l>
     <l n="419">Crowned with a rose-hued aureole , intent</l>
     <l n="420">On thoughts to save ; while from the grove a voice</l>
     <l n="421">Cried , “ Rishis ! this is He shall help the world ,</l>
     <l n="422">Descend and worship . ” So the Bright Ones came</l>
     <l n="423">And sang a song of praise , folding their wings ,</l>

     <l n="532">On the boy 's gaze , her stately neck unbent .</l>
     <l n="533">“ Is there a gift for me ? ” she asked , and smiled .</l>

     <l n="535">This for amends , dear sister , of whose grace</l>
     <l n="536">Our happy city boasts ; ” therewith he loosed</l>
     <l n="537">The emerald necklet from his throat , and clasped</l>
     <l n="538">Its green beads round her dark and silk-soft waist ;</l>

     <l n="574">Let messengers be sent to ask the maid</l>
     <l n="575">In marriage for my son . ” But it was law</l>
     <l n="576">With Sakyas , when any asked a maid</l>
     <l n="577">Of noble house , fair and desirable ,</l>
     <l n="578">He must make good his skill in martial arts</l>
     <l n="579">Against all suitors who should challenge it ;</l>
     <l n="580">Nor might this custom break itself for kings .</l>
     <l n="581">Therefore her father spake : “ Say to the King ,</l>
     <l n="582">The child is sought by princes far and near ;</l>
     <l n="583">If thy most gentle son can bend the bow ,</l>
     <l n="584">Sway sword , and back a horse better than they ,</l>
     <l n="585">Best would he be in all and best to us</l>
     <l n="586">But how shall this be , with his cloistered ways ? ”</l>
     <l n="587">Then the King 's heart was sore , for now the Prince</l>
     <l n="588">Begged sweet Yasodhara for wife — in vain ,</l>

     <l n="604">Amid her kinsfolk , carried as a bride ,</l>
     <l n="605">With music , and with litters gaily dight ,</l>
     <l n="606">And gold-horned oxen , flower-caparisoned .</l>

     <l n="609">The flower of all youths there , till the Prince came</l>

     <l n="613">On all those people born beneath the throne ,</l>
     <l n="614">Otherwise housed than kings , otherwise fed ,</l>
     <l n="615">And yet so like — perchance — in joys and griefs .</l>
     <l n="616">But when the Prince saw sweet Yasodhara ,</l>
     <l n="617">Brightly he smiled , and drew his silken rein ,</l>
     <l n="618">Leaped to the earth from Kantaka 's broad back ,</l>
     <l n="619">And cried , “ He is not worthy of this pearl</l>
     <l n="620">Who is not worthiest ; let my rivals prove</l>
     <l n="621">If I have dared too much in seeking her . ”</l>
     <l n="622">Then Nanda challenged for the arrow-test</l>
     <l n="623">And set a brazen drum six gows away ,</l>
     <l n="624">Ardjuna six and Devadatta eight ;</l>
     <l n="625">But Prince Siddartha bade them set his drum</l>
     <l n="626">Ten gows from off the line , until it seemed</l>
     <l n="627">A cowry-shell for target . Then they loosed ,</l>
     <l n="628">And Nanda pierced his drum , Ardjuna his ,</l>
     <l n="629">And Devadatta drove a well-aimed shaft</l>
     <l n="630">Through both sides of his mark , so that the crowd</l>
     <l n="631">Marvelled and cried ; and sweet Yasodhara</l>
     <l n="632">Dropped the gold sari o'er her fearful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="633">Lest she should see her Prince 's arrow fail .</l>
     <l n="634">But he , taking their bow of lacquered cane ,</l>
     <l n="635">With sinews bound , and strung with silver wire ,</l>
     <l n="636">Which none but stalwart arms could draw a span ,</l>
     <l n="637">Thrummed it — low laughing — drew the twisted string</l>
     <l n="638">Till the horns kissed , and the thick belly snapped</l>
     <l n="639">“ That is for play , not love , ” he said ; “ hath none</l>
     <l n="640">A bow more fit for Sakya lords to use ? ”</l>
     <l n="641">And one said , “ There is Sinhahanu 's bow ,</l>
     <l n="642">Kept in the temple since we know not when ,</l>
     <l n="643">Which none can string , nor draw if it be strung . ”</l>
     <l n="644">“ Fetch me , ” he cried , “ that weapon of a man ! ”</l>
     <l n="645">They brought the ancient bow , wrought of black steel ,</l>
     <l n="646">Laid with gold tendrils on its branching curves</l>
     <l n="647">Like bison-horns ; and twice Siddartha tried</l>
     <l n="648">Its strength across his knee , then spake “ Shoot now</l>
     <l n="649">With this , my cousins ! ” but they could not bring</l>
     <l n="650">The stubborn arms a hand'shYpppHeNbreadth nigher use ;</l>
     <l n="651">Then the Prince , lightly leaning , bent the bow ,</l>
     <l n="652">Slipped home the eye upon the notch , and twanged</l>
     <l n="653">Sharply the cord , which , like an eagle 's wing</l>
     <l n="654">Thrilling the air , sang forth so clear and loud</l>
     <l n="655">That feeble folk at home that day inquired</l>
     <l n="656">“ What is this sound ? ” and people answered them ,</l>
     <l n="657">“ It is the sound of Sinhahanu 's bow ,</l>
     <l n="658">Which the King 's son has strung and goes to shoot ; ”</l>
     <l n="659">Then fitting fair a shaft , he drew and loosed ,</l>
     <l n="660">And the keen arrow clove the sky , and drave</l>
     <l n="661">Right through that farthest drum , nor stayed its flight ,</l>
     <l n="662">But skimmed the plain beyond , past reach of eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="663">Then Devadatta challenged with the sword ,</l>
     <l n="664">And clove a Talas-tree six fingers thick ;</l>
     <l n="665">Ardjuna seven ; and Nanda cut through nine ;</l>
     <l n="666">But two such stems together grew , and both</l>
     <l n="667">Siddartha 's blade shred at one flashing stroke ,</l>
     <l n="668">Keen , but so smooth that the straight trunks upstood ,</l>
     <l n="669">And Nanda cried , “ His edge turned ! ” and the maid</l>
     <l n="670">Trembled anew seeing the trees erect ,</l>
     <l n="671">Until the Devas of the air , who watched ,</l>
     <l n="672">Blew light breaths from the south , and both green crowns</l>
     <l n="673">Crashed in the sand , clean-felled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="674">Then brought they steeds ,</l>
     <l n="675">High-mettled , nobly-bred , and three times scoured</l>
     <l n="676">Around the maidan , but white Kantaka</l>
     <l n="677">Left even the fleetest far behind — so swift ,</l>
     <l n="678">That ere the foam fell from his mouth to earth</l>
     <l n="679">Twenty spear-lengths he flew ; but Nanda said ,</l>
     <l n="680">“ We too might win with such as Kantaka ;</l>
     <l n="681">Bring an unbroken horse , and let men see</l>
     <l n="682">Who best can back him . ” So the syces brought</l>
     <l n="683">A stallion dark as night , led by three chains ,</l>
     <l n="684">Fierce-eyed , with nostrils wide and tossing mane ,</l>
     <l n="685">Unshod , unsaddled , for no rider yet</l>
     <l n="686">Had crossed him . Three times each young Sakya</l>
     <l n="687">Sprang to his mighty back , but the hot steed</l>
     <l n="688">Furiously reared , and flung them to the plain</l>
     <l n="689">In dust and shame ; only Ardjuna held</l>
     <l n="690">His seat awhile , and , bidding loose the chains ,</l>
     <l n="691">Lashed the black flank , and shook the bit , and held</l>
     <l n="692">The proud jaws fast with grasp of master-hand ,</l>
     <l n="693">So that in storms of wrath and rage and fear</l>
     <l n="694">The savage stallion circled once the plain</l>
     <l n="695">Half-tamed ; but sudden turned with naked teeth ,</l>
     <l n="696">Gripped by the foot Ardjuna , tore him down ,</l>
     <l n="697">And would have slain him , but the grooms ran in ,</l>
     <l n="698">Fettering the maddened beast . Then all men cried ,</l>
     <l n="699">“ Let not Siddartha meddle with this Bhut ,</l>
     <l n="700">Whose liver is a tempest , and his blood</l>
     <l n="701">Red flame ; ” but the Prince said , “ Let go the chains ,</l>
     <l n="702">Give me his forelock only , ” which he held</l>
     <l n="703">With quiet grasp , and , speaking some low word ,</l>
     <l n="704">Laid his right palm across the stallion 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="705">And drew it gently down the angry face ,</l>
     <l n="706">And all along the neck and panting flanks ,</l>
     <l n="707">Till men astonished saw the night-black horse</l>
     <l n="708">Sink his fierce crest and stand subdued and meek ,</l>
     <l n="709">As though he knew our Lord and worshipped him .</l>
     <l n="710">Nor stirred he while Siddartha mounted , then</l>
     <l n="711">Went soberly to touch of knee and rein</l>
     <l n="712">Before all eyes , so that the people said ,</l>
     <l n="713">“ Strive no more , for Siddartha is the best . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="714">And all the suitors answered “ He is best ! ”</l>
     <l n="715">And Suprabuddha , father of the maid ,</l>

     <l n="758">Black-broidered like the veil Yasodhara</l>

     <l n="829">The threshold alabaster , and the doors</l>
     <l n="830">Sandalwood , cut in pictured panelling ;</l>
     <l n="831">Whereby to lofty halls and shadowy bowers</l>
     <l n="832">Passed the delighted foot , on stately stairs ,</l>
     <l n="833">Through latticed galleries , ‘ neath painted roofs</l>
     <l n="834">And clustering columns , where cool fountains — fringed</l>
     <l n="835">With lotus and nelumbo — danced , and fish</l>
     <l n="836">Gleamed through their crystal , scarlet , gold , and blue .</l>
     <l n="837">Great-eyed gazelles in sunny alcoves browsed</l>
     <l n="838">The blown red roses ; birds of rainbow wing</l>
     <l n="839">Fluttered among the palms ; doves , green and grey ,</l>
     <l n="840">Built their safe nests on gilded cornices ;</l>
     <l n="841">Over the shining pavements peacocks drew</l>
     <l n="842">The splendours of their trains , sedately watched</l>
     <l n="843">By milk-white herons and the small house-owls .</l>
     <l n="844">The plum-necked parrots swung from fruit to fruit ;</l>
     <l n="845">The yellow sunbirds whirred from bloom to bloom ,</l>
     <l n="846">The timid lizards on the lattice basked</l>
     <l n="847">Fearless , the squirrels ran to feed from hand ,</l>
     <l n="848">For all was peace : the shy black snake , that gives</l>
     <l n="849">Fortune to households , sunned his sleepy coils</l>
     <l n="850">Under the moon-flowers , where the musk-deer played ,</l>
     <l n="851">And brown-eyed monkeys chattered to the crows .</l>
     <l n="852">And all this house of love was peopled fair</l>
     <l n="853">With sweet attendance , so that in each part</l>
     <l n="854">With lovely sights were gentle faces found ,</l>
     <l n="855">Soft speech and willing service , each one glad</l>
     <l n="856">To gladden , pleased at pleasure , proud to obey ;</l>
     <l n="857">Till life glided beguiled , like a smooth stream</l>

     <l n="861">Beyond the richness of those hundred halls ,</l>
     <l n="862">A secret chamber lurked , where skill had spent</l>
     <l n="863">All lovely fantasies to lull the mind .</l>
     <l n="864">The entrance of it was a cloistered square —</l>
     <l n="865">Roofed by the sky , and in the midst a tank —</l>
     <l n="866">Of milky marble built , and laid with slabs</l>
     <l n="867">Of milk-white marble ; bordered round the tank</l>
     <l n="868">And on the steps , and all along the frieze</l>
     <l n="869">With tender inlaid work of agate-stones .</l>
     <l n="870">Cool as to tread in summer-time on snows</l>
     <l n="871">It was to loiter there ; the sunbeams dropped</l>
     <l n="872">Their gold , and , passing into porch and niche ,</l>
     <l n="873">Softened to shadows , silvery , pale , and dim ,</l>
     <l n="874">As if the very Day paused and grew Eve .</l>
     <l n="875">In love and silence at that bower 's gate ;</l>
     <l n="876">For there beyond the gate the chamber was ,</l>
     <l n="877">Beautiful , sweet ; a wonder of the world !</l>
     <l n="878">Soft light from perfumed lamps through windows fell</l>
     <l n="879">Of nakre and stained stars of lucent film</l>
     <l n="880">On golden cloths outspread , and silken beds ,</l>

     <l n="883">Here , whether it was night or day none knew ,</l>
     <l n="884">For always streamed that softened light , more bright</l>
     <l n="885">Than sunrise , but as tender as the eve 's ;</l>
     <l n="886">And always breathed sweet airs , more joy-giving</l>
     <l n="887">Than morning 's , but as cool as midnight 's breath ;</l>
     <l n="888">And night and day lutes sighed , and night and day</l>
     <l n="889">Delicious foods were spread , and dewy fruits ,</l>
     <l n="890">Sherbets new chilled with snows of Himalay ,</l>
     <l n="891">And sweetmeats made of subtle daintiness ,</l>
     <l n="892">With sweet tree-milk in its own ivory cup .</l>
     <l n="893">And night and day served there a chosen band</l>
     <l n="894">Of nautch girls , cup-bearers , and cymballers ,</l>
     <l n="895">Delicate , dark-browed ministers of love ,</l>
     <l n="896">Who fanned the sleeping eyes of the happy Prince ,</l>
     <l n="897">And when he waked , led back his thoughts to bliss</l>
     <l n="898">With music whispering through the blooms , and charm</l>
     <l n="899">Of amorous songs and dreamy dances , linked</l>
     <l n="900">By chime of ankle-bells and wave of arms</l>
     <l n="901">And silver vina-strings ; while essences</l>
     <l n="902">Of musk and champak and the blue haze spread</l>
     <l n="903">From burning spices soothed his soul again</l>
     <l n="904">To drowse by sweet Yasodhara ; and thus</l>

     <l n="935">With brazen folding-doors , which but to roll</l>
     <l n="936">Back on their hinges asked a hundred arms ;</l>

     <l n="1105">Thus all the path was kept with gladsome looks</l>
     <l n="1106">And filled with fair sights — for the King 's word was</l>
     <l n="1107">That such should be — when midway in the road ,</l>
     <l n="1108">Slow tottering from the hovel where he hid ,</l>
     <l n="1109">Crept forth a wretch in rags , haggard and foul ,</l>
     <l n="1110">An old , old man , whose shrivelled skin , suntanned ,</l>
     <l n="1111">Clung like a beast 's hide to his fleshless bones .</l>
     <l n="1112">Bent was his back with load of many days ,</l>
     <l n="1113">His eyepits red with rust of ancient tears ,</l>
     <l n="1114">His dim orbs blear with rheum , his toothless jaws</l>
     <l n="1115">Wagging with palsy and the fright to see</l>
     <l n="1116">So many and such joy . One skinny hand</l>
     <l n="1117">Clutched a worn staff to prop his quavering limbs ,</l>
     <l n="1118">And one was pressed upon the ridge of ribs</l>
     <l n="1119">Whence came in gasps the heavy painful breath .</l>
     <l n="1120">“ Alms ! ” moaned he , “ give , good people ! for I die</l>
     <l n="1121">Tomorrow or the next day ! ” then the cough</l>
     <l n="1122">Choked him , but still he stretched his palm , and stood</l>
     <l n="1123">Blinking , and groaning ‘ mid his spasms , “ Alms ! ”</l>
     <l n="1124">Then those around had wrenched his feeble feet</l>
     <l n="1125">Aside , and thrust him from the road again ,</l>
     <l n="1126">Saying , “ The Prince ! dost see ? get to thy lair ! ”</l>
     <l n="1127">But that Siddartha cried , “ Let be ! let be !</l>
     <l n="1128">Channa ! what thing is this who seems a man ,</l>
     <l n="1129">Yet surely only seems , being so bowed ,</l>
     <l n="1130">So miserable , so horrible , so sad ?</l>
     <l n="1131">Are men born sometimes thus ? What meaneth he</l>
     <l n="1132">Moaning ‘ tomorrow or next day I die ? ’</l>
     <l n="1133">Finds he no food that so his bones jut forth ?</l>
     <l n="1134">What woe hath happened to this piteous one ? ”</l>
     <l n="1135">Then answer made the charioteer , “ Sweet Prince !</l>
     <l n="1136">This is no other than an aged man .</l>
     <l n="1137">Some fourscore years ago his back was straight ,</l>
     <l n="1138">His eye bright , and his body goodly : now</l>
     <l n="1139">The thievish years have sucked his sap away ,</l>
     <l n="1140">Pillaged his strength and filched his will and wit ;</l>
     <l n="1141">His lamp has lost its oil , the wick burns black ;</l>
     <l n="1142">What life he keeps is one poor lingering spark</l>
     <l n="1143">Which flickers for the finish : such is age ;</l>
     <l n="1144">Why should your Highness heed ? ”</l>
     <l n="1145">Then spake the Prince</l>
     <l n="1146">“ But shall this come to others , or to all ,</l>
     <l n="1147">Or is it rare that one should be as he ? ”</l>
     <l n="1148">“ Most noble , ” answered Channa , “ even as he ,</l>
     <l n="1149">Will all these grow if they shall live so long . ”</l>
     <l n="1150">“ But , ” quoth the Prince , “ if I shall live as long</l>
     <l n="1151">Shall I be thus ; and if Yasodhara</l>
     <l n="1152">Live fourscore years , is this old age for her ,</l>
     <l n="1153">Jalini , little Hasta , Gautami ,</l>
     <l n="1154">And Gunga , and the others ? ” “ Yea , great Sir ! ”</l>
     <l n="1155">The charioteer replied . Then spake the Prince</l>
     <l n="1156">“ Turn back , and drive me to my house again !</l>
     <l n="1157">I have seen that I did not think to see . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="54">
     <l n="1158">Which pondering , to his beauteous Court returned</l>
     <l n="1159">Wistful Siddartha , sad of mien and mood ;</l>
     <l n="1160">Nor tasted he the white cakes nor the fruits</l>
     <l n="1161">Spread for the evening feast , nor once looked up</l>
     <l n="1162">While the best palace-dancers strove to charm</l>
     <l n="1163">Nor spake — save one sad thing — when wofully</l>
     <l n="1164">Yasodhara sank to his feet and wept ,</l>
     <l n="1165">Sighing , “ Hath not my Lord comfort in me ? ”</l>
     <l n="1166">“ Ah , Sweet ! ” he said , “ such comfort that my soul</l>
     <l n="1167">Aches , thinking it must end , for it will end ,</l>
     <l n="1168">And we shall both grow old , Yasodhara !</l>
     <l n="1169">Loveless , unlovely , weak , and old , and bowed .</l>
     <l n="1170">Nay , though we locked up love and life with lips</l>
     <l n="1171">So close that night and day our breaths grew one</l>
     <l n="1172">Time would thrust in between to filch away</l>
     <l n="1173">My passion and thy grace , as black Night steals</l>
     <l n="1174">The rose-gleams from you peak , which fade to grey</l>
     <l n="1175">And are not seen to fade . This have I found ,</l>
     <l n="1176">And all my heart is darkened with its dread ,</l>
     <l n="1177">And all my heart is fixed to think how Love</l>
     <l n="1178">Might save its sweetness from the slayer , Time ,</l>
     <l n="1179">Who makes men old . ” So through that night he sate</l>
     <l n="1180">Sleepless , uncomforted .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="55">
     <l n="1181">And all that night</l>
     <l n="1182">The King Suddhodana dreamed troublous dreams .</l>
     <l n="1183">The first fear of his vision was a flag</l>
     <l n="1184">Broad , glorious , glistening with a golden sun ,</l>
     <l n="1185">The mark of Indra ; but a strong wind blew ,</l>
     <l n="1186">Rending its folds divine , and dashing it</l>
     <l n="1187">Into the dust ; whereat a concourse came</l>
     <l n="1188">Of shadowy Ones , who took the spoiled silk up</l>
     <l n="1189">And bore it eastward from the city gates .</l>
     <l n="1190">The second fear was ten huge elephants ,</l>
     <l n="1191">With silver tusks and feet that shook the earth ,</l>
     <l n="1192">Trampling the southern road in mighty march ;</l>
     <l n="1193">And he who sate upon the foremost beast</l>
     <l n="1194">Was the King 's son — the others followed him .</l>
     <l n="1195">The third fear of the vision was a car ,</l>
     <l n="1196">Shining with blinding light , which four steeds drew ,</l>
     <l n="1197">Snorting white smoke and champing fiery foam ;</l>
     <l n="1198">And in the car the Prince Siddhartha sate .</l>
     <l n="1199">The fourth fear was a wheel which turned and turned ,</l>
     <l n="1200">With nave of burning gold and jewelled spokes ,</l>
     <l n="1201">And strange things written on the binding tire ,</l>
     <l n="1202">Which seemed both fire and music as it whirled .</l>
     <l n="1203">The fifth fear was a mighty drum , set down</l>
     <l n="1204">Midway between the city and the hills ,</l>
     <l n="1205">On which the Prince beat with an iron mace ,</l>
     <l n="1206">So that the sound pealed like a thunderstorm ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Rolling around the sky and far away .</l>
     <l n="1208">The sixth fear was a tower , which rose and rose</l>
     <l n="1209">High o'er the city till its stately head</l>
     <l n="1210">Shone crowned with clouds , and on the top the Prince</l>
     <l n="1211">Stood , scattering from both hands , this way and that ,</l>
     <l n="1212">Gems of most lovely light , as if it rained</l>
     <l n="1213">Jacynths and rubies ; and the whole world came ,</l>
     <l n="1214">Striving to seize those treasures as they fell</l>
     <l n="1215">Towards the four quarters . But the seventh fear was</l>
     <l n="1216">A noise of wailing , and behold six men</l>
     <l n="1217">Who wept and gnashed their teeth , and laid their palms</l>
     <l n="1218">Upon their mouths , walking disconsolate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="56">
     <l n="1219">These seven fears made the vision of his sleep ,</l>
     <l n="1220">But none of all his wisest dream-readers</l>
     <l n="1221">Could tell their meaning . Then the King was wroth ,</l>
     <l n="1222">Saying , “ There cometh evil to my house ,</l>
     <l n="1223">And none of ye have wit to help me know</l>
     <l n="1224">What the great gods portend sending me this . ”</l>
     <l n="1225">So in the city men went sorrowful</l>
     <l n="1226">Because the King had dreamed seven signs of fear</l>
     <l n="1227">Which none could read ; but to the gate there came</l>
     <l n="1228">An aged man , in robe of deer-skin clad ,</l>
     <l n="1229">By guise a hermit , known to none ; he cried ,</l>
     <l n="1230">“ Bring me before the King , for I can read</l>
     <l n="1231">The vision of his sleep ” ; who , when he heard</l>
     <l n="1232">The sevenfold mysteries of the midnight dream ,</l>
     <l n="1233">Bowed reverent and said : “ O Maharaj !</l>
     <l n="1234">I hail this favoured House , whence shall arise</l>
     <l n="1235">A wider-reaching splendour than the sun 's !</l>
     <l n="1236">Lo ! all these seven fears are seven joys ,</l>
     <l n="1237">Whereof the first , where thou didst see a flag —</l>
     <l n="1238">Broad , glorious , gilt with Indra 's badge — cast down</l>
     <l n="1239">And carried out , did signify the end</l>
     <l n="1240">Of old faiths and beginning of the new ,</l>
     <l n="1241">For there is change with gods not less than men ,</l>
     <l n="1242">And as the days pass kalpas pass at length .</l>
     <l n="1243">The ten great elephants that shook the earth</l>
     <l n="1244">The ten great gifts of wisdom signify ,</l>
     <l n="1245">In strength whereof the Prince shall quit his state</l>
     <l n="1246">And shake the world with passage of the Truth .</l>
     <l n="1247">The four flame-breathing horses of the car</l>
     <l n="1248">Are those four fearless virtues which shall bring</l>
     <l n="1249">Thy son from doubt and gloom to gladsome light ;</l>
     <l n="1250">The wheel that turned with nave of burning gold</l>
     <l n="1251">Was that most precious Wheel of perfect Law</l>
     <l n="1252">Which he shall turn in sight of all the world .</l>
     <l n="1253">The mighty drum whereon the Prince did beat ,</l>
     <l n="1254">Till the sound filled all lands , doth signify</l>
     <l n="1255">The thunder of the preaching of the Word</l>
     <l n="1256">Which he shall preach ; the tower that grew to heaven</l>
     <l n="1257">The growing of the Gospel of this Buddh</l>
     <l n="1258">Sets forth ; and those rare jewels scattered thence</l>
     <l n="1259">The untold treasures are of that good Law</l>
     <l n="1260">To gods and men dear and desirable .</l>
     <l n="1261">Such is the interpretation of the tower ;</l>
     <l n="1262">But for those six men weeping with shut mouths ,</l>
     <l n="1263">They are the six chief teachers whom thy son</l>
     <l n="1264">Shall , with bright truth and speech unanswerable ,</l>
     <l n="1265">Convince of foolishness . O King ! rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="1266">The fortune of my Lord the Prince is more</l>
     <l n="1267">Than kingdoms , and his hermit-rags will be</l>
     <l n="1268">Beyond fine cloths of gold . This was thy dream !</l>
     <l n="1269">And in seven nights and days these things shall fall . ”</l>
     <l n="1270">So spake the holy man , and lowly made</l>
     <l n="1271">The eight prostrations , touching thrice the ground ;</l>
     <l n="1272">Then turned and passed ; but when the King bade send</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="57">
     <l n="1273">A rich gift after him , the messengers</l>
     <l n="1274">Brought word , “ We came to where he entered in</l>
     <l n="1275">At Chandra 's temple , but within was none</l>
     <l n="1276">Save a grey owl which fluttered from the shrine . ”</l>
     <l n="1277">The gods come sometimes thus .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="58">
     <l n="1278">But the sad King</l>
     <l n="1279">Marvelled , and gave command that new delights</l>
     <l n="1280">Be compassed to enthrall Siddartha 's heart</l>
     <l n="1281">Amid those dancers of his pleasure-house ,</l>
     <l n="1282">Also he set at all the brazen doors</l>
     <l n="1283">A doubled guard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="59">
     <l n="1284">Yet who shall shut out Fate ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="60">
     <l n="1285">For once again the spirit of the Prince</l>
     <l n="1286">Was moved to see this world beyond his gates ,</l>
     <l n="1287">This life of man , so pleasant if its waves</l>
     <l n="1288">Ran not to waste and woful finishing</l>
     <l n="1289">In Time 's dry sands . “ I pray you let me view</l>
     <l n="1290">Our city as it is , ” such was his prayer</l>
     <l n="1291">To King Suddhodana . “ Your Majesty</l>
     <l n="1292">In tender heed hath warned the folk before</l>
     <l n="1293">To put away ill things and common sights ,</l>
     <l n="1294">And make their faces glad to gladden me ,</l>
     <l n="1295">And all the causeways gay ; yet have I learned</l>
     <l n="1296">This is not daily life , and if I stand</l>
     <l n="1297">Nearest , my father , to the realm and thee ,</l>
     <l n="1298">Fain would I know the people and the streets ,</l>
     <l n="1299">Their simple usual ways , and workday deeds ,</l>
     <l n="1300">And lives which those men live who are not kings .</l>
     <l n="1301">Give me good leave , dear Lord , to pass unknown</l>
     <l n="1302">Beyond my happy gardens ; I shall come</l>
     <l n="1303">The more contented to their peace again ,</l>
     <l n="1304">Or wiser , father , if not well content .</l>
     <l n="1305">Therefore , I pray thee , let me go at will</l>
     <l n="1306">Tomorrow , with my servants , through the streets . ”</l>
     <l n="1307">And the King said , among his Ministers</l>
     <l n="1308">“ Belike this second flight may mend the first .</l>
     <l n="1309">Note how the falcon starts at every sight</l>
     <l n="1310">New from his hood , but what a quiet eye</l>
     <l n="1311">Cometh of freedom ; let my son see all ,</l>
     <l n="1312">And bid them bring me tidings of his mind . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="61">
     <l n="1313">Thus on the morrow , when the noon was come ,</l>
     <l n="1314">The Prince and Channa passed beyond the gates ,</l>
     <l n="1315">Which opened to the signet of the King ,</l>
     <l n="1316">Yet knew not they who rolled the great doors back</l>
     <l n="1317">It was the King 's son in that merchant 's robe ,</l>
     <l n="1318">And in the clerkly dress his charioteer .</l>

     <l n="1324">The buyers with their money in the cloth ,</l>
     <l n="1325">The war of words to cheapen this or that ,</l>
     <l n="1326">The shout to clear the road , the huge stone wheels ,</l>
     <l n="1327">The strong slow oxen and their rustling loads ,</l>
     <l n="1328">The singing bearers with the palanquins ,</l>

     <l n="1366">A stricken wretch it was , whose quivering frame ,</l>

     <l n="2575">Her painted hide hung wrinkled on her ribs ,</l>
     <l n="2576">As when between the rafters sinks a thatch</l>
     <l n="2577">Rotten with rains ; and at the poor lean dugs</l>
     <l n="2578">Two cubs , whining with famine , tugged and sucked ,</l>
     <l n="2579">Mumbling those milkless teats which rendered nought ,</l>
     <l n="2580">While she , their gaunt dam , licked full motherly</l>

     <l n="2587">Save the immense compassion of a Buddh ,</l>
     <l n="2588">Our Lord bethought , “ There is no other way</l>

     <l n="3036">Nor any staying of his whirling wheel . ”</l>
     <l n="3037">But quoth our Lord , “ Thou hast no part with me ,</l>
     <l n="3038">False Visikitcha , subtlest of man 's foes . ”</l>
     <l n="3039">And third came she who gives dark creeds their power ,</l>
     <l n="3040">Silabbat-paramasa , sorceress ,</l>
     <l n="3041">Draped fair in many lands as lowly Faith ,</l>
     <l n="3042">But ever juggling souls with rites and prayers ;</l>
     <l n="3043">The keeper of those keys which lock up Hells</l>

     <l n="3048">But Buddha answered , “ What thou bidd'st me keep</l>
     <l n="3049">Is form which passes , but the free Truth stands ;</l>
     <l n="3050">Get thee unto thy darkness . ” Next there drew</l>
     <l n="3051">Gallantly nigh a braver Tempter , he ,</l>
     <l n="3052">Kama , the King of passions , who hath sway</l>
     <l n="3053">Over the gods themselves , lord of all loves ,</l>
     <l n="3054">Ruler of Pleasure 's realm . Laughing he came</l>
     <l n="3055">Unto the Tree , bearing his bow of gold</l>
     <l n="3056">Wreathed with red blooms , and arrows of desire</l>
     <l n="3057">Pointed with five-tongued delicate flame which stings</l>
     <l n="3058">The heart it smites sharper than poisoned barb .</l>
     <l n="3059">And round him came into that lonely place</l>
     <l n="3060">Bands of bright shapes with heavenly eyes and lips</l>
     <l n="3061">Singing in lovely words the praise of Love</l>
     <l n="3062">To music of invisible sweet chords ,</l>
     <l n="3063">So witching , that it seemed the night stood still</l>
     <l n="3064">To hear them , and the listening stars and moon ,</l>
     <l n="3065">Paused in their orbits while these hymned to Buddh</l>

     <l n="3073">Unspeakable , yet speaking , soul to soul ,</l>
     <l n="3074">Owned by the bounding blood , worshipped by will</l>

     <l n="3080">And all life melted to a happy sigh ,</l>
     <l n="3081">And all the world was given in one warm kiss ?</l>
     <l n="3082">So sang , they with soft float of beckoning hands ,</l>
     <l n="3083">Eyes lighted with love-flames , alluring smiles ;</l>
     <l n="3084">In dainty dance their supple sides and limbs</l>
     <l n="3085">Revealing and concealing like burst buds</l>
     <l n="3086">Which tell their colour , but hide yet their hearts .</l>

     <l n="3092">Also , when nothing moved our Master 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="3093">Lo ! Kama waved his magic bow , and lo !</l>
     <l n="3094">The band of dancers opened , and a shape</l>
     <l n="3095">Fairest and stateliest of the throng came forth</l>
     <l n="3096">Wearing the guise of sweet Yasodhara .</l>
     <l n="3097">Tender the passion of those dark eyes seemed</l>
     <l n="3098">Brimming with tears ; yearning those outspread arms</l>
     <l n="3099">Opened towards him ; musical that moan</l>
     <l n="3100">Wherewith the beauteous shadow named his name ,</l>
     <l n="3101">Sighing : “ My Prince ! I die for lack of thee !</l>

     <l n="3107">Once , and these fruitless dreams will end ! Ah , look !</l>
     <l n="3108">Am I not she thou lovedst ? ” But Buddh said :</l>

     <l n="3110">Fair and false Shadow , is thy playing vain ;</l>
     <l n="3111">I curse thee not who wear'st a form so dear ,</l>
     <l n="3112">Yet as thou art , so are all earthly shows .</l>

     <l n="3309">Their tender lids . Over the spangled grass</l>
     <l n="3310">Swept the swift footsteps of the lovely Light ,</l>
     <l n="3311">Turning the tears of Night to joyous gems ,</l>
     <l n="3312">Decking the earth with radiance , ‘ broidering</l>
     <l n="3313">The sinking storm-clouds with a golden fringe ;</l>
     <l n="3314">Gilding the feathers of the palms , which waved</l>
     <l n="3315">Glad salutation ; darting beams of gold</l>
     <l n="3316">Into the glades ; touching with magic wand</l>
     <l n="3317">The stream to rippled ruby ; in the brake</l>
     <l n="3318">Finding the mild eyes of the antelopes</l>
     <l n="3319">And saying , “ It is day ” ; in nested sleep</l>
     <l n="3320">Touching the small heads under many a wing</l>
     <l n="3321">And whispering , “ Children , praise the light of day ! ”</l>
     <l n="3322">Whereat there piped anthems of all the birds !</l>
     <l n="3323">The koil 's fluted song , the bulbul 's hymn ,</l>
     <l n="3324">The “ morning , morning ” of the painted thrush ,</l>
     <l n="3325">The twitter of the sunbirds starting forth</l>
     <l n="3326">To find the honey ere the bees be out ,</l>
     <l n="3327">The grey crow 's caw , the parrot 's scream , the strokes</l>
     <l n="3328">Of the green hammersmith , the myna 's chirp ,</l>
     <l n="3329">The never finished love-talk of the doves</l>
     <l n="3330">Yea ! and so holy was the influence</l>
     <l n="3331">Of that high Dawn which came with victory</l>
     <l n="3332">That , far and near , in homes of men there spread</l>
     <l n="3333">An unknown peace . The slayer hid his knife ;</l>
     <l n="3334">The robber laid his plunder back ; the shroff</l>
     <l n="3335">Counted full tale of coins ; all evil hearts</l>
     <l n="3336">Grew gentle , kind hearts gentler , as the balm</l>
     <l n="3337">Of that divinest Daybreak lightened Earth .</l>
     <l n="3338">Kings at fierce war called truce ; the sick men leaped</l>
     <l n="3339">Laughing from beds of pain ; the dying smiled</l>
     <l n="3340">As though they knew that happy Morn was sprung</l>
     <l n="3341">From fountains farther than the utmost East ;</l>
     <l n="3342">And o'er the heart of sad Yasodhara ,</l>
     <l n="3343">Sitting forlorn at Prince Siddartha 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="3344">Came sudden bliss , as if love should not fail</l>
     <l n="3345">Nor such vast sorrow miss to end in joy .</l>
     <l n="3346">So glad the World was — though it wist not why —</l>
     <l n="3347">That over desolate wastes went swooning songs</l>
     <l n="3348">Of mirth , the voice of bodiless Prets and Bhuts</l>
     <l n="3349">Foreseeing Buddh ; and Devas in the air Cried ,</l>
     <l n="3350">“ It is finished , finished ! ” and the priests</l>
     <l n="3351">Stood with the wondering people in the streets</l>

     <l n="3353">And saying , “ There hath happed some mighty thing . ”</l>

     <l n="3361">With deadly fangs in sheath ; the shrike let pass</l>
     <l n="3362">The nestling finch ; the emerald halcyons</l>

     <l n="3476">Melt at her springs — uprose Yasodhara</l>
     <l n="3477">And clapped her palms , and laughed , with brimming tears</l>

     <l n="3490">Whom , when they came without the purdah 's folds ,</l>
     <l n="3491">A voice , tender and eager , filled and charmed</l>
     <l n="3492">With trembling music , saying : “ Ye are come</l>

     <l n="3546">Yet pondered the compassion of our Lord ,</l>
     <l n="3547">But in that hour there rang a voice as sharp</l>
