   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION .</head>
    <p n="1">To this edition of “ The Unknown Eros ” are added all the other poems I have written , in what I venture — because it has no other name — to call “ catalectic verse . ” Nearly all English metres owe their existence as metres to “ catalexis , ” or pause , for the time of one or more feet , and , as a rule , the position and amount of catalexis are fixed . But the verse in which this volume is written is catalectic par excellence , employing the pause ( as it does the rhyme ) with freedom only limited by the exigencies of poetic passion . From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own , some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the wings of this verse ; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts , on the part sometimes of considerable poets , to adapt it to purposes with which it has no expressional correspondence ; or to vary it by rhythmical movements which are destructive of its character .</p>
    <p n="2">Some persons , unlearned in the subject of metre , have objected to this kind of verse that it is “ lawless . ” But it has its laws as truly as any other . In its highest order , the lyric or “ ode , ” it is a tetrameter , the line having the time of eight iambics . When it descends to narrative , or the expression of a less-exalted strain of thought , it becomes a trimeter , having the time of six iambics , or even a dimeter , with the time of four ; and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter “ ode ” by the occasional introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures , but not , I think , by the use of any other . The license to rhyme at indefinite intervals is counterbalanced , in the writing of all poets who have employed this metre successfully , by unusual frequency in the recurrence of the same rhyme . For information on the generally overlooked but primarily important function of catalexis in English verse I refer such readers as may be curious about the subject to the Essay printed as an appendix to the later editions of my collected poems .</p>
    <p n="3">I do not pretend to have done more than very moderate justice to the exceeding grace and dignity and the inexhaustible expressiveness of which this kind of metre is capable ; but I can say that I have never attempted to write in it in the absence of that one justification of and prime qualification for its use , namely , the impulse of some thought that “ voluntary moved harmonious numbers . ”</p>

    <head>PROEM .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Many speak wisely , some inerrably :</l>
     <l n="2">Witness the beast who talk 'd that should have bray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Caiaphas that said</l>
     <l n="4">Expedient ‘ twas for all that One should die ;</l>
     <l n="5">But what avails</l>
     <l n="6">When Love 's right accent from their wisdom fails ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the Truth-criers know not what they cry !</l>
     <l n="8">Say , wherefore thou ,</l>
     <l n="9">As under bondage of some bitter vow ,</l>
     <l n="10">Warblest no word ,</l>
     <l n="11">When all the rest are shouting to be heard ?</l>
     <l n="12">Why leave the fervid running just when Fame</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Gan whispering of thy name</l>
     <l n="14">Amongst the hard-pleased Judges of the Course ?</l>
     <l n="15">Parch 'd is thy crystal-flowing source ?</l>
     <l n="16">Pierce , then , with thought 's steel probe , the trodden ground ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till passion 's buried floods be found ;</l>
     <l n="18">Intend thine eye</l>
     <l n="19">Into the dim and undiscover 'd sky</l>
     <l n="20">Whose lustres are the pulsings of the heart ,</l>
     <l n="21">And promptly , as thy trade is , watch to chart</l>
     <l n="22">The lonely suns , the mystic hazes and throng 'd sparkles bright</l>
     <l n="23">That , named and number 'd right</l>
     <l n="24">In sweet , transpicuous words , shall glow alway</l>
     <l n="25">With Love 's three-stranded ray ,</l>
     <l n="26">Red wrath , compassion golden , lazuline delight . ’</l>
     <l n="27">Thus , in reproof of my despondency ,</l>
     <l n="28">My Mentor ; and thus I :</l>
     <l n="29">O , season strange for song !</l>
     <l n="30">And yet some timely power persuades my lips .</l>
     <l n="31">Is't England 's parting soul that nerves my tongue ,</l>
     <l n="32">As other Kingdoms , nearing their eclipse ,</l>
     <l n="33">Have , in their latest bards , uplifted strong</l>
     <l n="34">The voice that was their voice in earlier days ?</l>
     <l n="35">Is it her sudden , loud and piercing cry ,</l>
     <l n="36">The note which those that seem too weak to sigh</l>
     <l n="37">Will sometimes utter just before they die ?</l>
     <l n="38">Lo , weary of the greatness of her ways ,</l>
     <l n="39">There lies my Land , with hasty pulse and hard ,</l>
     <l n="40">Her ancient beauty marr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="41">And , in her cold and aimless roving sight ,</l>
     <l n="42">Horror of light ;</l>
     <l n="43">Sole vigour left in her last lethargy ,</l>
     <l n="44">Save when , at bidding of some dreadful breath ,</l>
     <l n="45">The rising death</l>
     <l n="46">Rolls up with force ;</l>
     <l n="47">And then the furiously gibbering corse</l>
     <l n="48">Shakes , panglessly convuls 'd , and sightless stares ,</l>
     <l n="49">Whilst one Physician pours in rousing wines ,</l>
     <l n="50">One anodynes ,</l>
     <l n="51">And one declares</l>
     <l n="52">That nothing ails it but the pains of growth .</l>
     <l n="53">My last look loth</l>
     <l n="54">Is taken ; and I turn , with the relief</l>
     <l n="55">Of knowing that my life-long hope and grief</l>
     <l n="56">Are surely vain ,</l>
     <l n="57">To that unshapen time to come , when She ,</l>
     <l n="58">A dim , heroic Nation long since dead ,</l>
     <l n="59">The foulness of her agony forgot ,</l>
     <l n="60">Shall all benignly shed</l>
     <l n="61">Through ages vast</l>
     <l n="62">The ghostly grace of her transfigured past</l>
     <l n="63">Over the present , harass 'd and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="64">Of nations yet unborn ;</l>
     <l n="65">And this shall be the lot</l>
     <l n="66">Of those who , in the bird-voice and the blast</l>
     <l n="67">Of her omniloquent tongue ,</l>
     <l n="68">Have truly sung</l>
     <l n="69">Or greatly said ,</l>
     <l n="70">To shew as one</l>
     <l n="71">With those who have best done ,</l>
     <l n="72">And be as rays ,</l>
     <l n="73">Thro ’ the still altering world , around her changeless head .</l>
     <l n="74">Therefore no ‘ plaint be mine</l>
     <l n="75">Of listeners none ,</l>
     <l n="76">No hope of render 'd use or proud reward ,</l>
     <l n="77">In hasty times and hard ;</l>
     <l n="78">But chants as of a lonely thrush 's throat</l>
     <l n="79">At latest eve ,</l>
     <l n="80">That does in each calm note</l>
     <l n="81">Both joy and grieve ;</l>
     <l n="82">Notes few and strong and fine ,</l>
     <l n="83">Gilt with sweet day 's decline ,</l>
     <l n="84">And sad with promise of a different sun .</l>
     <l n="85">‘ Mid the loud concert harsh</l>
     <l n="86">Of this fog-folded marsh ,</l>
     <l n="87">To me , else dumb ,</l>
     <l n="88">Uranian Clearness , come !</l>
     <l n="89">Give me to breathe in peace and in surprise</l>
     <l n="90">The light-thrill 'd ether of your rarest skies ,</l>
     <l n="91">Till inmost absolution start</l>
     <l n="92">The welling in the grateful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="93">The heaving in the heart .</l>
     <l n="94">Winnow with sighs</l>
     <l n="95">And wash away</l>
     <l n="96">With tears the dust and stain of clay ,</l>
     <l n="97">Till all the Song be Thine , as beautiful as Morn ,</l>
     <l n="98">Bedeck 'd with shining clouds of scorn ;</l>
     <l n="99">And Thou , Inspirer , deign to brood</l>
     <l n="100">O'er the delighted words , and call them Very Good .</l>
     <l n="101">This grant , Clear Spirit ; and grant that I remain</l>
     <l n="102">Content to ask unlikely gifts in vain .</l>

      <l n="1">Well dost thou , Love , thy solemn Feast to hold</l>
      <l n="2">In vestal February ;</l>
      <l n="3">Not rather choosing out some rosy day</l>
      <l n="4">From the rich coronet of the coming May ,</l>
      <l n="5">When all things meet to marry !</l>
      <l n="6">O , quick , praevernal Power</l>
      <l n="7">That signall'st punctual through the sleepy mould</l>
      <l n="8">The Snowdrop 's time to flower ,</l>
      <l n="9">Fair as the rash oath of virginity</l>
      <l n="10">Which is first-love 's first cry ;</l>
      <l n="11">O , Baby Spring ,</l>
      <l n="12">That flutter'st sudden ‘ neath the breast of Earth</l>
      <l n="13">A month before the birth ;</l>
      <l n="14">Whence is the peaceful poignancy ,</l>
      <l n="15">The joy contrite ,</l>
      <l n="16">Sadder than sorrow , sweeter than delight ,</l>
      <l n="17">That burthens now the breath of everything ,</l>
      <l n="18">Though each one sighs as if to each alone</l>
      <l n="19">The cherish 'd pang were known ?</l>
      <l n="20">At dusk of dawn , on his dark spray apart ,</l>
      <l n="21">With it the Blackbird breaks the young Day 's heart ;</l>
      <l n="22">In evening 's hush</l>
      <l n="23">About it talks the heavenly-minded Thrush ;</l>
      <l n="24">The hill with like remorse</l>
      <l n="25">Smiles to the Sun 's smile in his westering course ;</l>
      <l n="26">The fisher 's drooping skiff</l>
      <l n="27">In yonder sheltering bay ;</l>
      <l n="28">The choughs that call about the shining cliff ;</l>
      <l n="29">The children , noisy in the setting ray ;</l>
      <l n="30">Own the sweet season , each thing as it may ;</l>
      <l n="31">Thoughts of strange kindness and forgotten peace</l>
      <l n="32">In me increase ;</l>
      <l n="33">And tears arise</l>
      <l n="34">Within my happy , happy Mistress ’ eyes ,</l>
      <l n="35">And , lo , her lips , averted from my kiss ,</l>
      <l n="36">Ask from Love 's bounty , ah , much more than bliss !</l>
      <l n="37">Is't the sequester 'd and exceeding sweet</l>
      <l n="38">Of dear Desire electing his defeat ?</l>
      <l n="39">Is't the waked Earth now to yon purpling cope</l>
      <l n="40">Uttering first-love 's first cry ,</l>
      <l n="41">Vainly renouncing , with a Seraph 's sigh ,</l>
      <l n="42">Love 's natural hope ?</l>
      <l n="43">Fair-meaning Earth , foredoom 'd to perjury !</l>
      <l n="44">Behold , all-amorous May ,</l>
      <l n="45">With roses heap 'd upon her laughing brows ,</l>
      <l n="46">Avoids thee of thy vows !</l>
      <l n="47">Were it for thee , with her warm bosom near ,</l>
      <l n="48">To abide the sharpness of the Seraph 's sphere ?</l>
      <l n="49">Forget thy foolish words ;</l>
      <l n="50">Go to her summons gay ,</l>
      <l n="51">Thy heart with dead , wing 'd Innocencies fill 'd ,</l>
      <l n="52">Ev'n as a nest with birds</l>
      <l n="53">After the old ones by the hawk are kill 'd .</l>

      <l n="1326">That I should wait for thee</l>
      <l n="1327">To woo !</l>
      <l n="1328">Nor even dare to love , till thou lov'st me .</l>
      <l n="1329">How shameful , too ,</l>
      <l n="1330">Is this :</l>
      <l n="1331">That , when thou lov'st , I am at first afraid</l>
      <l n="1332">Of thy fierce kiss ,</l>
      <l n="1333">Like a young maid ;</l>

      <l n="1336">And , when thou partest , what a fickle mind</l>
      <l n="1337">Thou leav'st behind ,</l>
      <l n="1338">That , being a little absent from mine eye ,</l>
      <l n="1339">It straight forgets thee what thou art ,</l>
      <l n="1340">And ofttimes my adulterate heart</l>

     <l n="1">Whene'er mine eyes do my Amelia greet</l>

     <l n="3">As when , in childhood , turning a dim street ,</l>
     <l n="4">I first beheld the ocean .</l>
     <l n="5">There , where the little , bright , surf-breathing town ,</l>
     <l n="6">That shew 'd me first her beauty and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="7">Gathers its skirts against the gorse-lit down</l>
     <l n="8">And scatters gardens o'er the southern lea ,</l>
     <l n="9">Abides this Maid</l>
     <l n="10">Within a kind , yet sombre Mother 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who of her daughter 's graces seems almost afraid ,</l>
     <l n="12">Viewing them ofttimes with a scared forecast ,</l>

     <l n="20">I touch the notes which music cannot reach ,</l>
     <l n="21">Bidding ‘ Good-night ! ’</l>
     <l n="22">Wherefore it came that , till to-day 's dear date ,</l>
     <l n="23">I curs 'd the weary months which yet I have to wait</l>
     <l n="24">Ere I find heaven , one-nested with my mate .</l>
     <l n="25">To-day , the Mother gave ,</l>
     <l n="26">To urgent pleas and promise to behave</l>
     <l n="27">As she were there , her long-besought consent</l>
     <l n="28">To trust Amelia with me to the grave</l>
     <l n="29">Where lay my once-betrothed , Millicent :</l>

     <l n="39">To say ‘ How beauteous ! ’ than ‘ How good and kind ! ’</l>
     <l n="40">And so we went alone</l>
     <l n="41">By walls o'er which the lilac 's numerous plume</l>
     <l n="42">Shook down perfume ;</l>
     <l n="43">Trim plots close blown</l>
     <l n="44">With daisies , in conspicuous myriads seen ,</l>
     <l n="45">Engross 'd each one</l>
     <l n="46">With single ardour for her spouse , the sun ;</l>
     <l n="47">Garths in their glad array</l>
     <l n="48">Of white and ruddy branch , auroral , gay ,</l>
     <l n="49">With azure chill the maiden flow'r between ;</l>
     <l n="50">Meadows of fervid green ,</l>
     <l n="51">With sometime sudden prospect of untold</l>
     <l n="52">Cowslips , like chance-found gold ;</l>
     <l n="53">And broadcast buttercups at joyful gaze ,</l>
     <l n="54">Rending the air with praise ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like the six-hundred-thousand-voiced shout</l>
     <l n="56">Of Jacob camp 'd in Midian put to rout ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then through the Park ,</l>
     <l n="58">Where Spring to livelier gloom</l>
     <l n="59">Quicken 'd the cedars dark ,</l>
     <l n="60">And , ‘ gainst the clear sky cold ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which shone afar</l>
     <l n="62">Crowded with sunny alps oracular ,</l>
     <l n="63">Great chestnuts raised themselves abroad like cliffs of bloom ;</l>
     <l n="64">And everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="65">Amid the ceaseless rapture of the lark ,</l>
     <l n="66">With wonder new</l>
     <l n="67">We caught the solemn voice of single air ,</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Cuckoo ! ’</l>
     <l n="69">And when Amelia , ‘ bolden 'd , saw and heard</l>
     <l n="70">How bravely sang the bird ,</l>
     <l n="71">And all things in God 's bounty did rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="72">She who , her Mother by , spake seldom word ,</l>
     <l n="73">Did her charm 'd silence doff ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , to my happy marvel , her dear voice</l>
     <l n="75">Went as a clock does , when the pendulum 's off .</l>
     <l n="76">Ill Monarch of man 's heart the Maiden who</l>
     <l n="77">Does not aspire to be High-Pontiff too !</l>
     <l n="78">So she repeated soft her Poet 's line ,</l>
     <l n="79">‘ By grace divine ,</l>
     <l n="80">Not otherwise , O Nature , are we thine ! ’</l>
     <l n="81">And I , up the bright steep she led me , trod ,</l>
     <l n="82">And the like thought pursued</l>
     <l n="83">With , ‘ What is gladness without gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="84">And where is gratitude without a God ? ’</l>
     <l n="85">And of delight , the guerdon of His laws ,</l>
     <l n="86">She spake , in learned mood ;</l>
     <l n="87">And I , of Him loved reverently , as Cause ,</l>
     <l n="88">Her sweetly , as Occasion of all good .</l>
     <l n="89">Nor were we shy ,</l>
     <l n="90">For souls in heaven that be</l>
     <l n="91">May talk of heaven without hypocrisy .</l>
     <l n="92">And now , when we drew near</l>
     <l n="93">The low , gray Church , in its sequester 'd dell ,</l>
     <l n="94">A shade upon me fell .</l>
     <l n="95">Dead Millicent indeed had been most sweet ,</l>
     <l n="96">But I how little meet</l>
     <l n="97">To call such graces in a Maiden mine !</l>
     <l n="98">A boy 's proud passion free affection blunts ;</l>
     <l n="99">His well-meant flatteries oft are blind affronts ;</l>
     <l n="100">And many a tear</l>
     <l n="101">Was Millicent 's before I , manlier , knew</l>
     <l n="102">That maidens shine</l>
     <l n="103">As diamonds do ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which , though most clear ,</l>
     <l n="105">Are not to be seen through ;</l>
     <l n="106">And , if she put her virgin self aside</l>
     <l n="107">And sate her , crownless , at my conquering feet ,</l>
     <l n="108">It should have bred in me humility , not pride .</l>
     <l n="109">Amelia had more luck than Millicent :</l>
     <l n="110">Secure she smiled and warm from all mischance</l>
     <l n="111">Or from my knowledge or my ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="112">And glow 'd content</l>
     <l n="113">With my — some might have thought too much — superior age ,</l>
     <l n="114">Which seem 'd the gage</l>
     <l n="115">Of steady kindness all on her intent .</l>
     <l n="116">Thus nought forebade us to be fully blent .</l>
     <l n="117">While , therefore , now</l>
     <l n="118">Her pensive footstep stirr 'd</l>
     <l n="119">The darnell 'd garden of unheedful death ,</l>
     <l n="120">She ask 'd what Millicent was like , and heard</l>
     <l n="121">Of eyes like her 's , and honeysuckle breath ,</l>
     <l n="122">And of a wiser than a woman 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet fill 'd with only woman 's love , and how</l>
     <l n="124">An incidental greatness character 'd</l>
     <l n="125">Her unconsider 'd ways .</l>
     <l n="126">But all my praise</l>
     <l n="127">Amelia thought too slight for Millicent ,</l>
     <l n="128">And on my lovelier-freighted arm she leant ,</l>
     <l n="129">For more attent ;</l>
     <l n="130">And the tea-rose I gave ,</l>
     <l n="131">To deck her breast , she dropp 'd upon the grave .</l>
     <l n="132">‘ And this was her 's , ’ said I , decoring with a band</l>
     <l n="133">Of mildest pearls Amelia 's milder hand .</l>
     <l n="134">‘ Nay , I will wear it for her sake , ’ she said :</l>
     <l n="135">For dear to maidens are their rivals dead .</l>
     <l n="136">And so ,</l>
     <l n="137">She seated on the black yew 's tortured root ,</l>
     <l n="138">I on the carpet of sere shreds below ,</l>
     <l n="139">And nigh the little mound where lay that other ,</l>
     <l n="140">I kiss 'd her lips three times without dispute ,</l>
     <l n="141">And , with bold worship suddenly aglow ,</l>
     <l n="142">I lifted to my lips a sandall 'd foot ,</l>
     <l n="143">And kiss 'd it three times thrice without dispute .</l>
     <l n="144">Upon my head her fingers fell like snow ,</l>
     <l n="145">Her lamb-like hands about my neck she wreathed .</l>
     <l n="146">Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept ,</l>
     <l n="147">And with her bosom , whence the azalea breathed ,</l>
     <l n="148">She did my face full favourably smother ,</l>
     <l n="149">To hide the heaving secret that she wept !</l>
     <l n="150">Now would I keep my promise to her Mother ;</l>
     <l n="151">Now I arose , and raised her to her feet ,</l>
     <l n="152">My best Amelia , fresh-born from a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="153">Moth-like , full-blown in birthdew shuddering sweet ,</l>
     <l n="154">With great , kind eyes , in whose brown shade</l>
     <l n="155">Bright Venus and her Baby play 'd !</l>
     <l n="156">At inmost heart well pleased with one another ,</l>
     <l n="157">What time the slant sun low</l>
     <l n="158">Through the plough 'd field does each clod sharply shew ,</l>
     <l n="159">And softly fills</l>
     <l n="160">With shade the dimples of our homeward hills ,</l>
     <l n="161">With little said ,</l>
     <l n="162">We left the ‘ wilder 'd garden of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="163">And gain 'd the gorse-lit shoulder of the down</l>
     <l n="164">That keeps the north-wind from the nestling town ,</l>
     <l n="165">And caught , once more , the vision of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="166">Where , on the horizon 's dip ,</l>
     <l n="167">A many-sailed ship</l>
     <l n="168">Pursued alone her distant purpose grave ;</l>
     <l n="169">And , by steep steps rock-hewn , to the dim street</l>
     <l n="170">I led her sacred feet ;</l>
     <l n="171">And so the Daughter gave ,</l>
     <l n="172">Soft , moth-like , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="173">Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk ,</l>
     <l n="174">Back to her Mother , anxious in the dusk .</l>
     <l n="175">And now ‘ Good-night ! ’</l>
     <l n="176">Me shall the phantom months no more affright .</l>
     <l n="177">For heaven 's gates to open well waits he</l>

     <l n="7">By these a Death-in-Life did foully breathe</l>
     <l n="8">Out of a face that was one grate of teeth .</l>

     <l n="29">That thou should'st try</l>
     <l n="30">Those zigzag courses , in the welkin clear ;</l>
     <l n="31">Nor cruel Boy that , fledd'st thou straight</l>

     <l n="33">Might catch thee , for thy colours , with his cap .</l>

     <l n="8">‘ Glauce but now the third time did again</l>
     <l n="9">The thing which I forbade . I had to box her ears .</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Twas ill to see her both blue eyes</l>
     <l n="11">Settled in tears</l>
     <l n="12">Despairing on the skies ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the poor lip all pucker 'd into pain ;</l>
     <l n="14">Yet , for her sake , from kisses to refrain ! ’</l>
