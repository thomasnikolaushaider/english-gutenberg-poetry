    <docTitle><titlePart>Introductory Note The Song of Hiawatha is based on the legends and stories of many North American Indian tribes , but especially those of the Ojibway Indians of northern Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota . They were collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft , the reknowned historian , pioneer explorer , and geologist . He was superintendent of Indian affairs for Michigan from 1836 to 1841 . Schoolcraft married Jane , O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua ( The Woman of the Sound Which the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky ) , Johnston . Jane was a daughter of John Johnston , an early Irish fur trader , and O-shau-gus-coday-way-qua ( The Woman of the Green Prairie ) , who was a daughter of Waub-o-jeeg ( The White Fisher ) , who was Chief of the Ojibway tribe at La Pointe , Wisconsin .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Jane and her mother are credited with having researched , authenticated , and compiled much of the material Schoolcraft included in his Algic Researches (<date>1839</date>) and a revision published in<date>1856</date>as The Myth of Hiawatha . It was this latter revision that Longfellow used as the basis for The Song of Hiawatha . Longfellow began Hiawatha on June 25 ,<date>1854</date>, he completed it on March 29 ,<date>1855</date>, and it was published November 10 ,<date>1855</date>. As soon as the poem was published its popularity was assured . However , it also was severely criticized as a plagiary of the Finnish epic poem Kalevala . Longfellow made no secret of the fact that he had used the meter of the Kalevala ; but as for the legends , he openly gave credit to Schoolcraft in his notes to the poem . I would add a personal note here . My father 's roots include Ojibway Indians : his mother , Margaret Caroline Davenport , was a daughter of Susan des Carreaux , O-gee-em-a-qua ( The Chief Woman ) , Davenport whose mother was a daughter of Chief Waub-o-jeeg . Finally , my mother used to rock me to sleep reading portions of Hiawatha to me , especially : “ Wah-wah-taysee , little fire-fly , Little , flitting , white-fire insect Little , dancing , white-fire creature , Light me with your little candle , Ere upon my bed I lay me , Ere in sleep I close my eyelids ! ” Woodrow W. Morris April 1 ,<date>1991</date></docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The Song of Hiawatha Introduction Should you ask me , whence these stories ? Whence these legends and traditions , With the odors of the forest With the dew and damp of meadows , With the curling smoke of wigwams , With the rushing of great rivers , With their frequent repetitions , And their wild reverberations As of thunder in the mountains ? I should answer , I should tell you , “ From the forests and the prairies , From the great lakes of the Northland , From the land of the Ojibways , From the land of the Dacotahs , From the mountains , moors , and fen-lands Where the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah , Feeds among the reeds and rushes . I repeat them as I heard them From the lips of Nawadaha , The musician , the sweet singer . ” Should you ask where Nawadaha Found these songs so wild and wayward , Found these legends and traditions , I should answer , I should tell you , “ In the bird'shYpppHeNnests of the forest , In the lodges of the beaver , In the hoofprint of the bison , In the eyry of the eagle ! “ All the wild-fowl sang them to him , In the moorlands and the fen-lands , In the melancholy marshes ; Chetowaik , the plover , sang them , Mahng , the loon , the wild-goose , Wawa , The blue heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah , And the grouse , the Mushkodasa ! ” If still further you should ask me , Saying , “ Who was Nawadaha ? Tell us of this Nawadaha , ” I should answer your inquiries Straightway in such words as follow . “ In the vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley , By the pleasant water-courses , Dwelt the singer Nawadaha . Round about the Indian village Spread the meadows and the corn-fields , And beyond them stood the forest , Stood the groves of singing pine-trees , Green in Summer , white in Winter , Ever sighing , ever singing . “ And the pleasant water-courses , You could trace them through the valley , By the rushing in the Spring-time , By the alders in the Summer , By the white fog in the Autumn , By the black line in the Winter ; And beside them dwelt the singer , In the vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley . “ There he sang of Hiawatha , Sang the Song of Hiawatha , Sang his wondrous birth and being , How he prayed and how be fasted , How he lived , and toiled , and suffered , That the tribes of men might prosper , That he might advance his people ! ” Ye who love the haunts of Nature , Love the sunshine of the meadow , Love the shadow of the forest , Love the wind among the branches , And the rain-shower and the snow-storm , And the rushing of great rivers Through their palisades of pine-trees , And the thunder in the mountains , Whose innumerable echoes Flap like eagles in their eyries ;— Listen to these wild traditions , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye who love a nation 's legends , Love the ballads of a people , That like voices from afar off Call to us to pause and listen , Speak in tones so plain and childlike , Scarcely can the ear distinguish Whether they are sung or spoken ;— Listen to this Indian Legend , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple , Who have faith in God and Nature , Who believe that in all ages Every human heart is human , That in even savage bosoms There are longings , yearnings , strivings For the good they comprehend not , That the feeble hands and helpless , Groping blindly in the darkness , Touch God 's right hand in that darkness And are lifted up and strengthened ;— Listen to this simple story , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye , who sometimes , in your rambles Through the green lanes of the country , Where the tangled barberry-bushes Hang their tufts of crimson berries Over stone walls gray with mosses , Pause by some neglected graveyard , For a while to muse , and ponder On a half-effaced inscription , Written with little skill of song-craft , Homely phrases , but each letter Full of hope and yet of heart-break , Full of all the tender pathos Of the Here and the Hereafter ; Stay and read this rude inscription , Read this Song of Hiawatha !</titlePart></docTitle>
