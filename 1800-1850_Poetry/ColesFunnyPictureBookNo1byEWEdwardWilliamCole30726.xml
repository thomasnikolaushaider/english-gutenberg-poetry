   <p>[*] BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE : The reprintings of this book since Cole 's death in 1918 have involved very few changes , and in most cases it has been bibliographically misleading to term them “ editions ” . Undoubtedly , somewhere in the past , the distinction between a “ printing ” and an “ edition ” has not been understood . However , with due cognisance of the irregularity , the practice of giving each reprint a new edition number accompanied by a running sales total is being maintained for statistical interest .</p>

   <p>Australia Is The Best Country On Earth</p>
   <p>Australia a Grand Country</p>
   <p>I think that Australia , for it 's size , is , all-round , the best country in the world . It 's climate is pleasant and health-giving . It has no desolating blizzards , no frost bites , and few sunstrokes . In edible produce , for both size and quality , it stands very high , if not the highest . I have been in many lands , but never saw a country supply such a variety of products as Australia does — potatoes , onions , cabbages , carrots , peas , beans and scores of other vegetables in abundance . In fruits it produces apples , pears , plums , peaches , oranges , grapes , and Northern Australia also produces all the tropical fruits in abundance wherever cultivated . In corn Australia produces superior wheat , oats , barley , maize and all other kinds in abundance , especially when scientifically irrigated . As a milk , butter and meat country , it is one of the best in the world . It is the largest and best wool-producing country in the world . It contains the largest area in the world especially suitable for growing cotton , the most extensively-used clothing material . Flowers grow luxuriantly and beautifully whenever cultivated and watered . A few years ago when writing on the “ White Australia ” question , I stated that with high culture , water irrigation , and scientific irrigation , Australia was capable of supporting 400 millions of inhabitants . A high literary authority , in reviewing the book , remarked that this seemed like a “ gross exaggeration ” ; but probably he had not thought so much on the subject as I had .</p>
   <p>I will here concisely state the principle reasons for my opinion . The great want of Australia , to make it amazingly fruitful , is the complete conservation of water and it 's scientific application to the soil . Water , warmth , and soil will grow anything in Australia , if rationally managed . Australia has abundance of water now running to waste . On thousands of house-roofs water enough is caught for the domestic use of the respective families . Over large areas of the country there are 30 inches of rainfall , and the average rainfall over vast areas is 24 inches , and could be made much greater by cultivation . Four-fifths of this water now runs to waste . Again surface-parched Australia has vast areas of underground water which only require to be tapped and brought to the surface , to irrigate and fertilise the soil .</p>
   <p>Australia is also a country where timber grows well and fast , if planted in trenched ground and slightly irrigated . Hundreds of straight trees can be grown upon an acre of land if they are first planted thickly and some gradually thinned out . Many kinds of trees will grow upon very poor soil if they are properly planted and irrigated , as the bulk of their sustenance is derived from the air . One more remark about trees and their possibilities as food providers . Wherever any kind of tree will grow some kind of fruit tree will grow . There are hundreds of millions of gum trees growing in Australia . Where every one of these trees is , some kind of fruit tree would grow if properly planted and looked after .</p>
   <p>Again , to utilise Australia to it 's full extent the whole world should be sought through for the best plants and trees of every kind , and only the very best grown , and those in situations and soil best adapted for them .</p>
   <p>One argument against Australia is that much of its surface is sandy , but experiments and developments in various countries show that the planting of marram grass , lupins , and other plants ties even the drifting sand together and gradually , through their decay , turns the sandy wastes into fertile soil . Besides , science can , in many other ways , utilise the elements in the air to enrich the soil .</p>
   <p>Australia 's Mineral Resources</p>
   <p>It has been objected that in the above epitome no mention is made of the great mineral wealth of Australia . The reason is that minerals , exceedingly useful as they are in the arts , are not absolutely necessary ( with the exception perhaps of iron ) to the feeding , clothing , and housing of mankind . Vast multitudes have lived without them ; but it may be remarked that Australia is a country very rich in minerals ; some hold it the richest in the world . It possesses immense deposits of iron not yet utilised , and the most extensive gold-fields yet discovered . Australia and Tasmania have , according to the latest estimate of our Commonwealth Statistician , produced minerals to the value of £ 660 , 252 , 694 — comprising in round numbers , Gold £ 474 , 000 , 000 ; Tin £ 24 , 000 , 000 ; and other kinds £ 8 , 000 , 000 . The bulk of the above has been produced during the last 60 years , in a population rising from about 300 , 000 to 4 , 000 , 000 and it forecasts how vast the mineral-producing future of Australia is likely to be . Altogether Australia is a country as highly favoured by nature as any other of equal size upon earth , for the bountiful production of useful animals , vegetables , minerals , and men .</p>
   <p>The Best Country On Earth — Unknown Australia</p>
   <p>“ ‘ If we Australians took as much trouble to prepare for our summer as the Canadians take to forestall their winter , Australia would be THE MOST PROSPEROUS COUNTRY ON EARTH . ’</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The speaker was the Rev . A. R. Edgar , head of the Central Mission ,</l>
     <l n="2">Melbourne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ ‘ After circling the globe , then , you are still satisfied that</l>
     <l n="4">Australia is not a bad country to live in ? ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ ‘ The best , ’ said Mr Edgar , emphatically . ‘ I have no hesitation in saying that Canada and America are not to be compared with Australia . Unfortunately , England does n't know it . Australia herself does n't half realise it , and as for America and Canada , they have n't the remotest ghost of a notion of it . In England they learn with regrettable slowness , and their knowledge is scanty indeed ; but across the Atlantic the ignorance is deplorable . “ Australia ? ” says the Canadian . “ Oh yes ! Let 's see , that 's the place where it 's always droughty — yes , yes , to be sure , the place where y ’ can n't get a drink of water . ” He laughs at the idea of Australia producing as much wool and wheat as Canada , and bluntly tells you there 's no country on the face of the planet can grow wheat and wool like his . But the fact is , there is n't a bit of territory fit to compare with the Western District of Victoria , for example , and conditions are infinitely harder for the agriculturist than in Australia . Canada 's western district is icebound in winter , and her eastern lands are strewn over with great boulders , between which the plough works laboriously in and out ’ . ” — From the “ New Idea . ”</p>
   <p>I often feel for the dweller in Canada ; for notwithstanding his beautiful spring and autumn he has six months of ice and snow and freezing winds , and I feel selfishly grateful that my lot is cast in more genial Australia .</p>
   <p>Let us well ponder Mr. Edgar 's concise and forcible statement : “ If we Australians took as much trouble to prepare for our summer as the Canadians take to forestall their winter , Australia would be the most prosperous country on earth . ”</p>
   <p>This is quite true . The Canadian must thoughtfully and rationally prepare for his winter , or he would freeze and starve . We have no frigid climate to prepare against , but we have possible drought , and our first and greatest consideration should be the conservation of water for irrigation .</p>
   <p>This water conservation is exceedingly important thing . Men do not think , and the waste is enormous . When the rain falls it runs into the gully , from the gully to the creek , from the creek to the river , from the river into the sea ; and then in the dry season water is deplorably scarce .</p>
   <p>I once asked a young squatter from the New South Wales side of the Murray “ Have you got a garden ? ” He answered : “ No : it is too dry up our way ! ” I said , “ How do you get water for domestic purposes ? ” He answered , “ We catch it off the roof ; we catch it in 11 tanks and are never out of a supply . ” I asked , “ How large an area have all your roofs put together ? ” He answered , “ I think about 20 feet by 100 feet . ” This would be about a twentieth of an acre . Now just reflect ! One acre of rainfall would supply , if caught , 20 establishments like that squatter 's home , for the rain would fall fairly alike over that part of the country . A rainfall of 30 inches over an acre of ground measures about 680 , 000 gallons and weighs about 3000 tons , the bulk of which is allowed to run away every year !</p>
   <p>A gentleman said to me the other day , “ Since the water was brought to Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie , under Sir John Forrest 's great scheme , they have very beautiful gardens right along the line of supply . Wherever the water touches the land the vegetation is splendid , and , what is more , the evaporation is bringing heavier rainfall . ” Of course , wherever cultivation and irrigation are carried on , more evaporation takes place , and , in most cases , causes additional rainfall .</p>
   <p>When I affirmed that Australia was capable of supporting 400 millions of people I did not mean Australia as we now have it , but as it might be , and probably will be , when water is carefully conserved and its soil scientifically irrigated and cultivated .</p>

   <p>[*] Our friend , the Quaker , holds that the last verse is the proper one , as it is the truest ; but the wonderful is taken out of it , and children , accordingly , prefer the first . There is nothing wonderful in the cow jumping “ under ” the moon , but there is in the cow jumping “ over ” the moon , so with the black-birds baked in a pie . It is the fact of their singing when the pie is opened that pleases the children — ‘ twas the wonder of the thing ; so with the freaks of Mother Hubbard 's Dog , etc . In nearly all nursery rhymes it is the ludicrous and wonderful that arrests the attention and pleases . E. W. Cole</p>

     <l n="866">Little Red Riding Hood</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a dear little girl whose mother made her a scarlet cloak with a hood to tie over her pretty head ; so people called her ( as a pet name ) “ Little Red Riding-Hood . ” One day her mother tied on her cloak and hood and said ,</p>
   <p>“ I wish you to go to-day , my darling , to see your grandmamma , and take her a present of some butter , fresh eggs , a pot of honey , and a little cake with my love . ”</p>
   <p>Little Red Riding-Hood loved her grandmother , and was very glad to go . So she ran gaily through the wood , gathering wild flowers and gambolling among the ferns as she went ; and the birds all sang their sweetest songs to her , and the bluebells nodded their pretty heads , for everything loved the gentle child .</p>
   <p>By and by a great hungry Wolf came up to her . He wished to eat her up , but as he heard the woodman Hugh 's axe at work close by , he was afraid to touch her , for fear she should cry out and he should get killed . So he only asked her where she was going . Little Red Riding-Hood innocently told him ( for she did not know he was a wicked Wolf ) that she was going to visit her grandmother , who lived in a cottage on the other side of the wood . Then the Wolf made haste , and ran through the wood , and came to the cottage of which the child had told him . He tapped at the door .</p>
   <p>“ Who 's there ? ” asked the old woman , who lay sick in bed .</p>
   <p>“ It is Little Red Riding-Hood , Grandmamma , ” answered the Wolf in a squeaky tone , to imitate the voice of her grandchild .</p>
   <p>“ Pull the string , and the latch will come up , ” said the old lady , “ for I am ill and cannot open the door . ”</p>
   <p>The cruel Wolf did so , and , jumping on the bed , ate the poor grandmother up .</p>
   <p>Then he put on her night-cap and got into bed . By and by Little Red Riding-Hood , who had lingered gathering flowers as she came along , and so was much later than the Wolf , knocked at the door .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Who 's there ? ” asked the Wolf , mimicking her grandmother 's voice .</l>
     <l n="2">“ It is Little Red Riding-Hood , dear Grandmamma , ” said the child .</l>
     <l n="3">“ Pull the string and the latch will come up , ” said the Wolf .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So Red Riding-Hood came in , and the Wolf told her to put down her basket , and come and sit on the bed . When Little Red Riding-Hood drew back the curtain and saw the Wolf , she began to be rather frightened and said ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Dear Grandmamma , what great eyes you have got ! ”</l>
     <l n="2">“ All the better to see you with , my dear , ” said the Wolf , who</l>
     <l n="3">liked a grim joke .</l>
     <l n="4">“ And what a large nose you have , Grandmamma ! ” cried the child .</l>
     <l n="5">“ All the better to smell you with , my dear . ”</l>
     <l n="6">“ And , oh ! Grandmamma , what long white teeth you have ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Alas ! she reminded the greedy Wolf of eating .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">“ All the better to eat you with ! ” he growled ; and , jumping out of</l>
     <l n="9">bed , sprang at Red Riding-Hood .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But just at that moment Hugh the woodman , who had seen the sweet child go by , and had followed her , because he knew there was a Wolf prowling about the forest , burst the door open , and killed the wicked animal with his good axe . Little Red Riding-Hood clung round his neck and thanked him , and cried for joy ; and Hugh took her home to her mother ; and after that she was never allowed to walk in the greenwood by herself .</p>
   <p>It was said at first that the Wolf had eaten the child , but that was not the case ; and everybody was glad to hear that the first report was not correct , and that the Wolf had not really killed Little Red Riding-Hood .</p>

     <l n="35">The Babes In The Wood</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A long time ago there lived in an old mansion in the country a rich gentleman and his wife , who had two dear little children , of whom they were very fond . Sad to relate , the gentleman and lady were both taken ill , and , feeling they were about to die , sent for the uncle of the children , and begged him to take care of them till they were old enough to inherit the estates .</p>
   <p>Now this uncle was a bad and cruel man , who wanted to take the house , the estates , and the money for himself ,— so after the death of the parents he began to think how he could best get rid of the children . For some time he kept them till he claimed for them all the goods that should have been theirs . At last he sent for two robbers , who had once been his companions , and showing them the boy and girl , who were at play , offered them a large sum of money to carry them away and never let him see them more .</p>
   <p>One of the two robbers began coaxing the little boy and girl , and asking them if they would not like to go out for a nice ride in the woods , each of them on a big horse . The boy said he should if his sister might go too , and the girl said she should not be afraid if her brother went with her . So the two robbers enticed them away from the house , and , mounting their horses , went off into the woods , much to the delight of the children , who were pleased with the great trees , the bright flowers , and the singing of the birds .</p>
   <p>Now , one of these men was not so bad and cruel as the other , and he would not consent to kill the poor little creatures , as the other had threatened he would do . He said that they should be left in the woods to stray about , and perhaps they might then escape . This led to a great quarrel between the two , and at last the cruel one jumped off his horse , saying he would kill them , let who would stand in the way . Upon this the other drew his sword to protect the children , and after a fierce fight succeeded in killing his companion .</p>
   <p>But though he had saved them from being murdered , he was afraid to take them back or convey them out of the wood , so he pointed out a path , telling them to walk straight on and he would come back to them when he had bought some bread for their supper ; he rode away and left them there all alone , with only the trees , and birds and flowers . They loved each other so dearly , and were so bold and happy , that they were not much afraid though they were both very hungry .</p>
   <p>The two children soon got out of the path , which led into the thickest part of the wood , and then they wandered farther and farther into the thicket till they were both sadly tired , but they found some wild berries , nuts and fruits , and began to eat them to satisfy their hunger . The dark night came on and the robber did not return . They were cold , and still very hungry , and the boy went about looking for fresh fruit for his sister , and tried to comfort her as they lay down to sleep on the soft moss under the trees .</p>
   <p>The next day , and the next , they roamed about , but there was nothing to eat but wild fruits ; and they lived on them till they grew so weak that they could not go far from the tree where they had made a little bed of grass and weeds . There they laid down as the shades of night fell upon them , and in the morning they were both in heaven , for they died there in the forest , and as the sun shone upon their little pale faces , the robins and other birds came and covered their bodies with leaves , and so died and were buried the poor Babes in the Wood .</p>

   <p>Cinderella</p>
   <p>Cinderella 's mother died while she was a very little child , leaving her to the care of her father and her step-sisters , who were very much older than herself ; for Cinderella 's father had been twice married , and her mother was his second wife . Now , Cinderella 's sisters did not love her , and were very unkind to her . As she grew older they made her work as a servant , and even sift the cinders : on which account they used to call her in mockery “ Cinderella . ” It was not her real name , but she became afterwards so well known by it that her proper one has been forgotten .</p>
   <p>She was a sweet tempered , good girl , however , and everybody except her cruel sisters loved her . It happened , when Cinderella was about seventeen years old , that the King of that country gave a ball , to which all the ladies of the land , and among the rest the young girl 's sisters were invited . So they made her dress them for this ball , but never thought of allowing her to go .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I wish you would take me to the ball with you , sisters , ” said</l>
     <l n="2">Cinderella , meekly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Take you , indeed ! ” answered the elder sister with a sneer , “ it</l>
     <l n="4">is no place for a cinder-sifter : stay at home and do your work . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When they were gone , Cinderella , whose heart was sad , sat down and cried ; but as she sorrowful , thinking of the unkindness of her sisters , a voice called to her from the garden , and she went to see who was there . It was her godmother , a good old Fairy .</p>
   <p>“ Do not cry , Cinderella , ” she said ; “ you also shall go to the ball , because you are a kind , good girl . Bring me a large pumpkin . ”</p>
   <p>Cinderella obeyed , and the fairy touched it with her wand , turned it into a grand coach . Then she turned a rat into a coach-man , and some mice into footmen ; and touching Cinderella with her wand , the poor girl 's rags became a rich dress trimmed with costly lace and jewels , and her old shoes became a charming pair of glass slippers , which looked like diamonds . The fairy told her to go to the ball and enjoy herself , but to be sure and leave the ball-room before the clock struck eleven . “ If you do not , ” she said , “ your fine clothes will all turn to rags again .</p>
   <p>So Cinderella got into the coach , and drove off with her six footmen behind , very splendid to behold , and arrived at the King 's Court , where she was received with delight . She was the most beautiful young lady at the ball , and the Prince would dance with no one else . But she made haste to leave before the hour fixed and had time to undress before her sisters came home . They told her a beautiful Princess had been at the ball , with whom the Prince was delighted . They did not know it was Cinderella herself .</p>
   <p>Three times Cinderella went to royal balls in this manner , but the third time she forgot the Fairy 's command , and heard eleven o'clock strike . She darted out of the ball-room and ran down stairs in a great hurry . But her dress all turned to rags before she left the palace and she lost one of her glass slippers . The Prince sought for her everywhere , but the guard said no one had passed the gate but a poor beggar girl . However , the prince found the slipper , and in order to discover where Cinderella was gone , he had it proclaimed that he would marry the lady who could put on the glass slipper . All the ladies tried to wear the glass slipper in vain , Cinderella 's sisters also , but when their young sister begged to be allowed to try it also , it was found to fit her exactly , and to the Prince 's delight , she drew the fellow slipper from her pocket , and he knew at once that she was his beautiful partner at the ball . So she was married to the Prince , and the children strewed roses in their path as they came out of church .</p>
   <p>Cinderella forgave her sisters , and was so kind to them that she made them truly sorry for their past cruelty and injustice .</p>
   <p>The Three Bears</p>
   <p>Once upon a time three bears lived in a nice little house in a great forest .</p>
   <p>There was Father Bear , Mother Bear , and Baby Bear .</p>
   <p>They had each a bed to sleep in , a chair to sit on , and a basin and a spoon for eating porridge , which was their favourite food .</p>
   <p>One morning the three bears went to take a walk before breakfast ; but before they went out they poured the hot porridge into their basins , that it might get cool by the time they came back . Mr and Mrs Bear walked arm-in-arm , and Baby Bear ran by their side . Now , there lived in that same forest a sweet little girl who was called Golden Hair . She , also , was walking that morning in the wood , and happening to pass by the bear 's house , and seeing the window open , she peeped in .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>The Three Bears .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>There was no one to be seen , but three basins of steaming hot porridge all ready to be eaten , seemed to say “ Come in and have some breakfast . ” So Golden Hair went in and tasted the porridge in all the basins , then she sat down in Baby Bear 's chair , and took up his spoon , and ate up all his porridge . Now this was very wrong . A tiny bear is only a tiny bear , still he has the right to keep his own things . But Golden Hair did n't know any better .</p>
   <p>Unluckily , Baby Bear 's chair was too small for her , and she broke the seat and fell through , basin and all .</p>
   <p>Then Golden Hair went upstairs , and there she saw three beds all in a row . Golden Hair lay down on Father Bear 's bed first , but that was too long for her , then she lay down on Mother Bear 's bed , and that was too wide for her , last of all she lay down on Baby Bear 's bed , and there she fell asleep , for she was tired .</p>
   <p>By-and-by the bears came home , and Old Father Bear looked at his chair , and growled :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Somebody has been here ! ”</l>
     <l n="2">Mother Bear growled more softly :</l>
     <l n="3">“ Somebody has been here ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Baby Bear , seeing his chair broken , squeeled out “ Somebody has been</l>
     <l n="5">here , and broken my chair right through ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Then they went to the table , and looked at their porridge , and Father</l>
     <l n="7">Bear Growled :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">“ Who has touched my basin ? ”</l>
     <l n="9">And Mother Bear growled :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Who has touched my basin ? ”</l>
     <l n="11">And Baby Bear squeaked :</l>
     <l n="12">“ Somebody has broken mine and eaten up all my porridge ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">They went upstairs and Father Bear growled :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Who has been lying on my bed ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">And Mother Bear growled :</l>
     <l n="16">“ Who has been lying on my bed ? ”</l>
     <l n="17">And Baby Bear squeaked out :</l>
     <l n="18">“ O ! here is a little girl in my bed ; and it must be she who has</l>
     <l n="19">eaten my breakfast and broken my chair and basin ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">Then Father Bear growled :</l>
     <l n="21">“ Let us eat her up ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">Then Mother Bear growled :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Let us eat her up ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">And Tiny Bear squeaked :</l>
     <l n="25">“ Let us eat her up ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But the noise they made awoke Golden Hair ; she startled out of bed ( on the opposite side ) and jumped out of the window . The three bears all jumped out after her , but they fell one on the top of the other , and rolled over and over , and while they were picking themselves up , little Golden Hair ran home , and they were not able to catch her .</p>
   <p>Bluebeard</p>
   <p>Once there lived in a lovely castle a very rich man called Bluebeard . A short distance off lived an old gentleman with two lovely daughters , named Fatima and Annie . Bluebeard visited their house , and at length proposed to Fatima , was accepted by her , and they were married with great splendour . He took her home with him to his castle , and permitted her sister Annie to reside with her for company for a time .</p>
   <p>She lived very happily in her new home , her new husband was very kind to her , and allowed her to have everything she wished for , but one day he suddenly told her that business called him away from home , that he should be away some days , and handed her the keys to his wardrobe , treasures , and all parts of the castle , he also gave her one key of a small closet , and told her that she might unlock every door in the castle , but not the closet door , for if she did so , she should not live an hour longer . He then left home fondly kissing her at the door .</p>
   <p>Her sister and herself returned into the castle , and enjoyed themselves in unlocking room after room , looking over the curiosities , treasures , &amp; c , until Annie became tired and lay down to rest on a rich sofa , and fell asleep . Fatima , as soon as she saw that her sister was asleep , felt a womanly curiosity , an irresistible temptation to unlock the forbidden closet , and take a peep .</p>
   <p>She tripped lightly up to the door , turned the key in the lock , pushed the door open , and , oh ! horror ! there were five or six dead ladies lying in the closet , with their marriage rings on their fingers . She at once concluded that they were Bluebeard 's previous wives , she let the key drop in her fright into the blood on the floor , she picked it up and attempted to wipe it , but the blood would not come off . She awoke her sister , and they both tried , but they could not get it off , and gave it up in despair .</p>
   <p>Just then Bluebeard suddenly returned , and asked his wife if she could please to hand him the keys . She trembling did so . He said “ How came the blood on the closet key ? You have disobeyed me , and shall die at once . ”</p>
   <p>She begged a few minutes to say her prayers and just as he was going to chop her head off , her two brothers arrived at the castle , burst open the door , killed the cruel wretch , and rescued their sisters .</p>

   <p>Once there was a funny old monkey — and this old monkey had six young monkeys . There was one white monkey , and one black monkey , and one yellow monkey , and one red monkey , and one blue monkey , and one green monkey ; and the white monkey 's name was Linda , and the black monkey 's name was Eddie , and the yellow monkey 's name was Vally , and the red monkey 's name was Ruby , and the blue monkey 's name was Pearl , and the green Monkey 's name was Ivy Diamond . And the white monkey liked apples , and the black monkey liked grapes , and the yellow monkey liked cherries , and the red monkey liked strawberries , and the blue monkey liked oranges , and the green monkey liked nuts , and that 's all about these FUNNY MONKEYS . The names of any children can be told in this story instead of Linda , Eddie , Vally , Ruby , Pearl , and Diamond .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="142">Cole 's Electro-micro Scolding Machine is a combination of three</l>
     <l n="143">instruments , the Phonograph , the Microphone , and the Wonderphone .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Phonograph is an instrument that will preserve words for any length of time . Any person can speak , sing , whistle , or scold into a Phonograph , and months or years afterwards by simply turning a handle the same sounds can be reproduced a dozen , a hundred , or a thousand times in the exact voice of the person who spoke them in ; so that if a man or a woman , who is a great scold , speak some good , loud , severe scolding into a Phonograph , the mildest teacher can then scold her pupils , or the kindest mother her children , just by turning the handle .</p>
   <p>The Microphone is an instrument that magnifies sound in the same way as a microscope magnifies objects ; a very powerful microphone magnifies the sound of a fly walking into a loud tramping footstep , the tick of a watch into a deafening clatter , and a whisper into a loud shout . Take a Microphone , then properly affix it to the Phonograph described above , and you have a good Scolding Machine ; turn the handle , and as the Phonograph gives out the scoldings , the microphone part magnifies them so loudly that they are heard for a considerable distance .</p>
   <p>The Wonderphone ( Cole 's own secret ) is another remarkable instrument ; it will cause sound to travel very distinctly , but frightfully and equally loud , for forty miles in all directions ; by attaching this powerful instrument to the combination of the other two , Cole 's Electro-micro Scolding Machine is formed — and which is the first Scolding Machine ever invented . If the machine is already charged by having had some scolding spoken , or even whispered into it , give the handle a turn , and forty miles to the east , forty miles to the west , forty to the north , forty to the south , forty up in the sky , and down in the mines forty miles deep , in fact forty miles in every direction , everybody can clearly hear every word being said to the girl being scolded . Suppose for instance , Hannah Maria Smith had done something wrong in school , the schoolmistress could give the handle of the machine a turn , and it would scold her so loudly that her mother , and father , and brothers , and sisters , and uncles , and aunts , and friends , and those she did n't like would all hear her scolded . The machine can be charged on the instant by anyone scolding into it . In fact the whole value of Cole 's Scolding Machine lies in its power to repeat out exceedingly loud whatever is spoken into it .</p>
   <p>If the schoolmistress chooses she can put the scolding into verse , so that all who hear it in the forty miles around , can more easily remember it . The machine that I have before me now , was charged this morning for an aristocratic school and speaks as follows :— Silence !! Attention !! !</p>

     <l n="55">Notice To The Public</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>If a schoolmistress chooses to live a hundred or a thousand miles away from her school , she can use the Scolding Machine by means of a Telephone attached thereto .</p>
   <p>One great advantage of the Electro-micro Scolding Machine is , that after it has been in use a short time the girls will all have been shamed into good behaviour ; but the Machine will not become useless , as it can , without a farthing outlay , be turned into a Praising Machine , for it can be made to praise in a gentle voice as well as scold in a harsh one . In fact , as said above it will repeat in exact tones , anything that is recited , preached , sung , whistled , whispered , shouted , scolded or praised into it — and any of which will be heard for forty miles around .</p>
   <p>Cole can supply Scolding Machines from £ 5 to £ 50 . A very good one ( The Excelsior ) , price £ 10 , can be charged in one minute , and set going like a musical box , and will sing , whistle , recite , preach , or scold away for a full hour without stopping . Cole would particularly recommend this one to the ladies , it would make a fine ornament for their own table .</p>
   <p>Final Notice Extraordinary — If the champion male scold of the world , and the champion female scold of the world , will call on Professor Cole , at the Book Arcade , Melbourne , he will give them both good wages , and find them constant employment at charging Scolding Machines . If any wife has got the champion male scold for a husband , she will please to let me know . If any husband has got the champion female scold for a wife , he will please to let me know —£ 10 bonus for information in each case .</p>

     <l n="261">Jack the Giant Killer</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there lived in Cornwall , England , a lad whose name was Jack , and who was very brave and knowing . At the same time there was a great Giant , twenty feet high and nine feet round , who lived in a cave , on an island near Jack 's house . The Giant used to wade to the mainland and steal things to live upon , carrying five or six bullocks at once , and stringing sheep , pigs , and geese around his waist-band ; and all the people ran away from him in fear , whenever they saw him coming .</p>
   <p>Jack determined to destroy this Giant ; so he got a pickaxe and shovel , and started in his boat on a dark evening ; by the morning he had dug a pit deep and broad , then covering it with sticks and strewing a little mould over , to make it look like plain ground , he blew his horn so loudly that the Giant awoke , and came roaring towards Jack , calling him a villain for disturbing his rest , and declaring he would eat him for breakfast . He had scarcely said this when he fell into the pit . “ Oh ! Mr . Giant , ” says Jack , “ where are you now ? You shall have this for your breakfast . ” So saying , he struck him on the head so terrible blow with his pickaxe that the Giant fell dead to the bottom .</p>
   <p>Just at this moment , the Giant 's brother ran out roaring vengeance against Jack ; but he jumped into his boat and pulled to the opposite shore , with the Giant after him , who caught poor Jack , just as he was landing , tied him down in his boat , and went in search of his provisions . During his absence , Jack contrived to cut a large hole in the bottom of the boat , and placed therein a piece of canvas . After having stolen some oxen , the Giant returned and pushed off the boat , when , having got fairly out to sea , Jack pulled the canvas from the hole , which caused the boat to fill and quickly capsize . The Giant roared and bellowed as he struggled in the water , but was very soon exhausted and drowned , while Jack dexterously swam ashore .</p>
   <p>One day after this , Jack was sitting by a well fast asleep . A Giant named Blundebore , coming for water , at once saw and caught hold of him , and carried him to his castle . Jack was much frightened at seeing the heaps of bodies and bones strewed about . The Giant then confined him in an upper room over the entrance , and went for another Giant to breakfast off poor Jack . On viewing the room , he saw some strong ropes , and making a noose at one end , he put the other through a pulley which chanced to be over the window , and when the Giants were unfastening the gate he threw the noose over both their heads , and pulling it immediately , he contrived to choke them both . Then releasing three ladies who were confined in the castle , he departed well pleased .</p>
   <p>About five or six months after , Jack was journeying through Wales , when , losing his way , he could find no place of entertainment , and was about giving up all hopes of obtaining shelter during the night when he came to a gate , and , on knocking , to his utter astonishment it was opened by a Giant , who did not seem so fierce as the others . Jack told him his distress , when the Giant invited him in , and , after giving him a hearty supper , showed him to bed . Jack had scarcely got into bed when he heard the Giant muttering to himself :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Though you lodge with me this night ,</l>
     <l n="2">You shall not see the morning light ;</l>
     <l n="3">My club shall dash your brains out quite . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Oh , Mr . Giant , is that your game ? ” said Jack to himself ; “ then I shall try and be even with you . ” So he jumped out of bed and put a large lump of wood there instead . In the middle of the night the Giant went into the room , and thinking it was Jack in the bed , he belaboured the wood most unmercifully ; he then left the room , laughing to think how he had settled poor Jack . The following morning Jack went boldly into the Giant 's room to thank him for the night 's lodging . The Giant was startled at his appearance , and asked him how he slept , or if anything had disturbed him in the night ? “ Oh , no , ” says Jack , “ nothing worth speaking about : I believe that a rat gave me a few slaps with his tail , but , being rather sleepy , I took no notice of it . ” The Giant wondered how Jack survived the terrific blows of his club , yet did not answer a word , but went and brought in two monstrous bowls of hasty pudding , placed one before Jack , and began eating the other himself . Determined to be revenged on the Giant somehow , Jack unbuttoned his leather provision bag inside his coat , and slyly filling it with hasty pudding , said , “ I 'll do what you can n't . ” So saying , he took up a large knife , and ripping up the bag , let out the hasty pudding . The Giant , determined not to be outdone , seized hold of the knife , and saying , “ I can do that , ” instantly ripped up his belly , and fell down dead on the spot .</p>
   <p>After this Jack fought and conquered many giants , married the king 's daughter and lived happily .</p>

    <p>Jack Climbing Beanstalk .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Jack and the Beanstalk</p>
   <p>At some distance from London , in a small village , lived a widow and her son , whose name was Jack . He was a bold , daring fellow , ready for any adventure which promised fun or amusement . Jack 's mother had a cow , of which she was very fond , and which , up to this time , had been their chief support . But as she had for some time past been growing poorer every year , she felt that now she must part with the cow . So she told Jack to take the cow to be sold , and he was to be sure to get a good round sum for her . On the road to market Jack met a butcher , who was carrying in his hat some things which Jack thought to be very pretty . The butcher saw how eagerly Jack eyed his beans , and said , “ If you want to sell your cow , my fine fellow , I will give you this whole hatful of beans in exchange for her . ”</p>
   <p>Jack was delighted ; he seized the hat , and ran back home . Jack 's mother was surprised to see him back so soon , and at once asked him for the money . But when Jack said he had sold the cow for a hatful of beans , she was so angry that she opened the window and threw them all out into the garden . When Jack rose up next morning he found that one of the beans had taken root , and had grown up , up , up , until its top was quite lost in the clouds . Jack resolved instantly to mount the Beanstalk . So up , up , up , he went till he had reached the very top . Looking round he saw at a distance a large house . Tired and weary , he crawled towards it and knocked on the door . The door was opened by a timid looking woman who started when she saw him , and besought him to run away as her husband was a cruel Giant who would eat him up if he found him there . But Jack begged so earnestly to be admitted that the woman , who was very kind-hearted , had pity on him , and so she brought him into the kitchen , and set before him on a table some bread , meat , and ale . Jack ate and drank , and soon felt quite refreshed . Presently the woman started and said , “ My husband ! quick , quick ! he comes — he comes ! ” and opened the door to the oven and bid Jack jump in . The Giant was in a dreadful passion when he came in , and almost killed his wife by a blow which he aimed at her . He then began to sniff and smell — at last he roared out :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Fee , fa , fi , fo , fum ,</l>
     <l n="2">I smell the blood of an Englishman !</l>
     <l n="3">Be he alive , or be he dead ,</l>
     <l n="4">I 'll grind his bones to make me bread ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His wife gave him an evasive answer , and proceeded to lay before him his supper . When the Giant could swallow no more , he called out to his wife to bring him his hen , which , after being brought , whenever the Giant said “ Lay , ” the hen laid a golden egg . The Giant soon fell asleep , and Jack crept out softly and seized the hen , and made off without disturbing the Giant . Away ran Jack till he came to the Beanstalk ; he was much sooner at the bottom of it now than at the top in the morning ; and running to his mother he told all his adventure .</p>
   <p>The hen laid as many golden eggs as Jack liked , and his mother before long had another cow and everything which she desired . A second time Jack climbed the Beanstalk , when he ran away with the Giant 's bag of money . A third time Jack climbed the Beanstalk , and again gained admission to the Giant 's house . He saw the Giant 's wife , and asked her for a night 's lodging . She at first said she could not let him into the house , but Jack begged so hard that at last she consented , and gave him some supper and put him to sleep in the copper boiler near the kitchen fireplace , where she thought the Giant would not find him .</p>
   <p>When the Giant came in , his good nose served him in a moment : for he cried out “ I smell fresh meat . ” Jack laughed at this , but it was no laughing matter ; for the Giant looked all around the room , and even put his finger on the lid of the copper , till it seemed as if a stone of a hundredweight had fallen upon the lid . Just then his wife came in with a whole roasted bullock smoking hot , which the Giant sat down and ate for his supper , and then went down into the cellar , and drank about six gallons of Jamaica rum . The Giant now sat down and went to sleep , and Jack tried to run away with his golden harp , an instrument which , when the Giant said “ play , ” played the most beautiful tunes . Now the harp was a fairy , and as soon as he touched it , it called out “ Master ! Master ! ” so loud that the Giant awoke , but he was some time before he could understand what was the matter . He tried to run after Jack , but Jack got to the top of the beanstalk first . When he had descended a little way he looked up , and how great was his horror to see the huge hand of the Giant stretched down to seize him by the hair of the head ! He slid and scrambled down the Beanstalk , hardly knowing how , and seeing the Giant just putting his feet over the top , he called out , “ Quick , mother ! A hatchet , a hatchet ! ” Jack seized it and chopped away at the beanstalk , when down it fell , bringing along with it the Giant . Jack instantly cut off his head . After this Jack and his mother lived very happily , and Jack was a great comfort to her in her old age .</p>

   <p>Hop O ’ My Thumb</p>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a woodman and his wife who had so many children that they did not know how to find food for them . So one night , when they were all in bed , the father told his wife that he thought they had better take them into the forest and lose them there . The youngest child , who was so very small that he was called Hop o ’ my Thumb , overheard his father , and as he was a very clever boy he made up his mind to find his way home again . So he went down to the brook very early the next morning , and filled his pocket with large smooth pebbles as white as snow . Bye-and-bye the woodman and his wife told the children that they might go with them into the wood to have a good game of play . They were all glad except Hop o ’ my Thumb who knew what his father intended . So they set out ; the woodman and his wife first , then the boys , and last Hop o ’ my Thumb , who sprinkled pebbles all the way they went .</p>
   <p>They spent a merry day ; but bye-and-bye the parents stole away , and left the children all by themselves . They were very much frightened when they missed their father and mother , and called loudly for them ; but when Hop o ’ my Thumb told them what he had heard , and how they could find their way home by following the track of the pebbles , which marked the way they had come , they set out , and reached home safely , and their father and mother pretended to be very glad to see them back .</p>
   <p>But soon after they again resolved to lose their children , if possible , in the forest . This time all the boys feared that they should be left behind , and the eldest brother said he would take some peas to sprinkle , to mark the pathway that led home . By-and-bye the cruel parents stole away , and left the little ones in the dark wood . At first they did not care , for they thought that they could easily find their way home ; but , alas ! when they looked for the line of peas which they had sprinkled , they found they were all gone — the wood-pigeons had eaten them up , and the children were lost in the wood . Holding each-others ’ hands and crying sadly they walked on to seek a place to sleep in . By-and-bye they came to a giant 's castle , where they were taken in , and told that they might sleep in the nursery with the seven baby daughters of the giant , who were lying all in a row in one bed , with gold crowns on their heads . Hop o ’ my Thumb thought it was strange that the giant should be so kind , as he had been told that the ogres eat children . So in the night he got up softly and took off the little giantesses ’ crowns and put them on his brothers ’ heads and his own , and lay down again . It was lucky for him that he did so , for in the night the giant came up in the dark to kill the boys , that they might be ready for the next day 's breakfast . He felt the beds , and finding the crowns on the boy 's heads took them for his own children , left them and went to the other bed and cut off the heads of his daughters instead . Then he went back to bed . Directly he was gone , Hop o ’ my Thumb and his brothers got up , stole down stairs , opened the door and fled away from the castle . But they did not go far . Hop o ’ my Thumb knew that the giant would come after them in his seven-league boots . So they got into a hole in the side of a hill and hid . Very soon after , they saw the giant coming at a great pace in his wonderful boots ; but he took such long steps that he passed right over their heads . They were afraid to move out till they had seen him go home again . So they remained quietly where they were .</p>
   <p>By-and-bye the giant , who had been many miles in an hour , came back tired , and lay down on the hill-side and fell asleep . Then Hop o ’ my Thumb got out of the hole , and pulled off the giant 's seven-league boots , and put them on his own feet . They fitted him exactly , for being fairy boots they would grow large or small just as one liked . He then got his brothers out of the hole , took them in his boots , marched for home , and although it was a great distance , got there in almost no time , but when he arrived at the house his father and mother were not there . He then hastened to make inquiries for them , and found they had been suspected of murdering their children ,— who had all disappeared suddenly — that they had owned to leaving them in the wood , and that they were to be put to death for their crime . “ We must go and save them , ” he said . So he took his brothers into the seven-league boots , and set out to the place where their parents were in prison . They arrived only just in time , for the guards were bringing out the woodsman and his wife to put them to death . Hop o ’ my Thumb took off the boors , and all the children called out , “ We are alive ! we are alive ! Do not kill our mother and father . ”</p>
   <p>Then there was great joy . The woodman and his wife were set free , and embraced their children . They had repented their wickedness , and were never unkind and cruel any more ; and Hop o ’ my Thumb kept them all in comfort by going on errands for the king in his seven-league boots .</p>

    <p>Tom Thumb Chased By Cat .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Tom Thumb</p>
   <p>In the days of good King Arthur there lived a ploughman and his wife who wished very much to have a son ; so the man went to Merlin , the enchanter , and asked him to let him have a child , even , if it were “ no bigger than his thumb . ” “ Go home and you will find one , ” said Merlin ; and when the man came back to his house he found his wife nursing a very , very , wee baby , who in four minutes grew to the size of the ploughman 's thumb , and never grew any more . The fairy queen came to his christening and named him “ Tom Thumb . ” She then dressed him nicely in a shirt of spider 's web , and a doublet and hose of thistledown .</p>
   <p>One day , while Tom 's mother was making a plum-pudding , Tom stood on the edge of the bowl , with a lighted candle in his hand , that she might see to make it properly . Unfortunately , however , while her back was turned , Tom fell into the bowl , and his mother not missing him , stirred him up in the pudding , and put it and him into the pot . Tom no sooner felt the hot water than he danced about like man ; the woman was nearly frightened out of her wits to see the pudding come out of the pot and jump about , and she was glad to give it to a tinker who was passing that way .</p>
   <p>The tinker was delighted with his present ; but as he was getting over a style , he happened to sneeze very hard , and Tom called out from the middle of the pudding , “ Hallo , Pickens ! ” which so terrified the tinker that he threw the pudding into the field , and scampered away as fast as he could . The pudding tumbled to pieces in the fall , and Tom , creeping out , went home to his mother , who was in great affliction because she could not find him . A few days afterwards Tom went with his mother into the fields to milk the cows , and for fear he should be blown away by the wind , she tied him to a thistle with a small piece of thread . Very soon after a cow ate up the thistle and swallowed Tom Thumb . His mother was in sad grief again ; but Tom scratched and kicked in the cow 's throat till she was glad to throw him out of her mouth again .</p>
   <p>One day Tom Thumb went ploughing with his father , who gave him a whip made of barley straw , to drive the oxen with ; but an eagle , flying by , caught him up in his beak , and carried him to the top of a great giant 's castle . The giant would have eaten Tom up ; but the fairy dwarf scratched and bit his tongue and held on by his teeth till the giant in a passion took him out again and threw him into the sea , when a very large fish swallowed him up directly . The fish was caught soon after and sent as a present to King Arthur , and when the cook opened it there was Tom Thumb inside . He was carried to the king , who was delighted with the little man .</p>
   <p>The king ordered a little chair to be made , in order that Tom might sit on his table , and also a palace of gold a span high , with a door an inch wide , for little Tom to live in . He also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice .</p>
   <p>This made the queen angry , because she had no a new coach too ; therefore , resolving to ruin Tom , she complained to the king that he had spoken insolently to her . The king sent for him . Tom , to escape his fury , crept into an empty snail shell , and lay there till he was almost starved ; when peeping out of the shell he saw a fine butterfly settled on the ground : he now ventured out , and getting on it , the butterfly took wing , and mounted into the air with little Tom on his back . Away he flew from field to field , from tree to tree , till at last he flew to the king 's court . The king , queen , and nobles all strove to catch the butterfly but could not . At length poor Tom , having neither bridle or saddle , slipped from his seat and fell into a pool of water , where he was found nearly drowned . The queen vowed he should be beheaded , and while the scaffold was getting ready , he was secured in a mouse-trap ; when the cat seeing something stir supposing it to be a mouse , patted the trap about till she broke it , and set Tom at liberty .</p>
   <p>Sometimes Tom rode out on a mouse for a horse . One day a big black met him along the road , and wanted to kill the mouse . Tom jumped off the mouse 's back , drew his sword , and fought the cat , and made her run away .</p>
   <p>In order to show his courage and please the queen , the new knight undertook a terrible adventure .</p>
   <p>In one corner of the palace garden there was found a great black spider , of which the lady was very much afraid .</p>
   <p>Tom undertook to kill this insect ; so he took a gold button for a shield , and his sharp needle-sword , and went out to attack the spider ; the knights went also , to witness the combat .</p>
   <p>Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly , but the spider 's poisonous breath overcame him .</p>
   <p>King Arthur and his whole Court went into mourning for little Tom Thumb . They buried him under a rose-bush , and raised a nice white marble monument over his grave .</p>

   <p>“ Nice child — very nice child , ” observed an old gentleman , crossing to the other side of the car and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye with a wad of paper . “ How old are you , my son ? ”</p>
   <p>“ None of your business , ” replied the youngster , taking aim at another passenger .</p>
   <p>“ Fine boy , ” smiled the old man , as the parent regarded her offspring with pride . “ A remarkably fine boy . What is your name , my son ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Puddin ’ Tame ! ” shouted the youngster , with a giggle at his own wit .</p>
   <p>“ I thought so , ” continued the old man , pleasantly . “ If you had given me three guesses at it , that would have been the first one I would have struck on . Now , Puddin ’ , you can blow those things pretty straight , can n't you ? ”</p>
   <p>“ You bet ! ” squealed the boy , delighted at the compliment . “ See me take that old fellow over there ! ”</p>
   <p>“ No , no ! ” exclaimed the old gentleman , hastily . “ Try it on the old woman I was sitting with . She has boys of her own , and she wo n't mind . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ca n't you hit the lady for the gentleman , Johnny ? ” asked the fond parent .</p>
   <p>Johnny cleverly landed the pellet on the end of the old woman 's nose .</p>
   <p>But she did mind it , and rising in her wrath soared down on the small boy like a hawk . She put him over the line , reversed him , ran him backwards , till he did n't know which end of him was front , and finally dropped him into the lap of the scared mother , with a benediction whereof the purport was that she 'd be back in a moment to skin him alive .</p>
   <p>“ She did n't seem to like it , Puddin ’ , ” smiled the old gentleman , softly . “ She 's a perfect stranger to me ; but I understand she is the matron of an Orphans ’ Home , and I thought she would like a little fun ; but I was mistaken . ”</p>
   <p>And the old man smiled sweetly as he went back to his seat . He was sorry for the poor little boy , but he could n't help it .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The boy not only preys on my melon-patch and fruit trees , and upon those of my neighbours , but he has an extraordinary aptitude for creating a disturbance in whatever spot he happens to be . Only last Sunday he caused such a terrible commotion in church that the services had to be suspended for several minutes until he could be removed . The interior of the edifice was painted and varnished recently , and I suppose one of the workers must have left a clot of varnish upon the back of Cooley 's pew , which is directly across the aisle from mine . Cooley 's boy was the only representative of the family at church upon that day , and he amused himself during the earlier portions of the service by kneeling upon the seat and communing with Dr. Jones ’ boy , who occupied the pew immediately in the rear . Sometimes , when young Cooley would resume a proper position , Jones 's boy would stir him up afresh by slyly pulling his hair , whereupon Cooley would wheel about and menace Jones with his fist in a manner which betrayed utter indifference to the proprieties of the place and the occasion , as well as the presence of the congregation . When Cooley finally sank into a condition of repose , he placed his head , most unfortunately , directly against the lump of undried varnish , while he amused himself by reading the commandments and the other scriptural texts upon the wall behind the pulpit .</p>
   <p>In a few moments he attempted to move , but the varnish had mingled with his hair , and it held him securely . After making one or two desperate but ineffectual efforts to release himself , he became very angry ; and supposing that Jones 's boy was holding him , he shouted :</p>
   <p>“ Leg go o ’ my hair ! Leg go o ’ my hair , I tell you ! ”</p>
   <p>The clergyman paused just as he was entering upon consideration of “ secondly , ” and the congregation looked around in amazement , in time to perceive young Cooley , with his head against the back of the pew , aiming dreadful blows over his shoulder with his fist at some unseen person behind him . And with every thrust he exclaimed :</p>
   <p>“ I 'll smash yer nose after church ! I 'll go for you , Bill Jones , when I ketch you alone ! Leg go o ’ my hair , I tell you , or I 'll knock the stuffin ’ out o ’ yer , ” etc , etc .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Jones 's boy sat up at the very end of his pew , far away from Cooley , and looked as solemn as if the sermon had made a deep impression upon him .</p>

     <l n="152">Declaration of a Distracted Schoolmaster .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A year ago I took charge of a school of 1000 boys . They were a very bad lot indeed , and I could do nothing with them . Being of a mild disposition , I attempted to reason with them ; but I might as well have reasoned with the pigs . I then thought of punishing them , but that was a big task , and , besides , what mode of punishment should I adopt ? In my utmost perplexity I wrote to Professor Wilderspin — a great authority on the management of boys — and he wrote as follows :</p>
   <p>“ Nearly all boys can be managed by an intelligent schoolmaster without punishment , but in a few cases it seems impossible to do without it . In every large school in England , Ireland , and Scotland some corporal punishment is used , and some must continue to be used as long as very vicious children continue to exist , or as long as parents spoil their children by over indulgence or by wilful criminal neglect before they send them to school . — Yours truly , Professor Wilderspin . ”</p>
   <p>I then wrote to twenty-seven of the principal headmasters in the world , and the following are the replies :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From the High School of Eton wrote head-master , Mr. Squeers :</l>

     <l n="27">From the National School of Bristol wrote Professor Mark Groom :</l>
     <l n="28">“ If the boys are extra naughty , shut them in a dark room . ”</l>
     <l n="29">From the District School of Edenburgh wrote head-master , Mr. Glass :</l>
     <l n="30">“ The naughty boys should all be sent to the bottom of the class . ”</l>

     <l n="38">“ Take your delinquent boys one hour and make them sit on nothing . ”</l>
     <l n="39">From the Public School , Chicago , wrote head-master , Mr. Norrids :</l>

     <l n="42">From , the Academy of San Francisco wrote head-master , Mr. Power :</l>

     <l n="45">From the Mormon School of Utah wrote Professor Orson Pratt :</l>
     <l n="46">“ First strip and make them fast , and then just use the little cat . ”</l>
     <l n="47">From the King 's College , Lisbon , wrote Professor Don Cassiers :</l>
     <l n="48">“ If you want to make them good boys , pull , pinch , and twist their</l>

     <l n="50">From the Cadet 's School of Paris wrote Professor Monsieur Sour :</l>

     <l n="66">And he says that it does no harm , but is felt throughout the</l>
     <l n="67">system . ”</l>
     <l n="68">At last , as I was thinking deep how puzzling all this looks ,</l>
     <l n="69">I received a tempting offer from a certain Mr. Snooks .</l>
     <l n="70">His “ great machine to whip with speed ” I brought with flusteration ,</l>

   <p>I have given no Fairy Tales in this Childland . For in this matter-of-fact age belief in Fairy Tales and all kinds of wonderful fictions is fast vanishing . Santa Claus , the “ bestest ” “ goodest ” fairy of all alone remains : and even he is gradually being doubted by all but the most innocent children , but as he as a personality is still largely amongst us , I give his popular history culled from many sources .</p>
   <p>Santa Claus Land</p>

     <l n="1">At the top of the earth , which they call the North Pole ,</l>

     <l n="12">And broad as a sunbeam is Santa Claus ’ smile .</l>

   <p>THE two greatest educating powers in the ancient world were Pictures and Poetry — the two greatest educating powers are pictures and poetry still , and pictures and poetry blended in an interesting manner is the intended educating feature of this PLEASANT-LEARNING-LAND , but my object in this place is to speak of pictures only , as perhaps the greatest of all educating powers , and to demonstrate that they are not sufficiently used for educational purposes . Firstly : pictures are in a universal language — when they are true to nature every person on the earth can understand them . Show a picture of a person or a bird , a horse or a house , a ship , a tree , or a landscape , and everyone knows what is meant , and this is why most of the peoples of the ancient world conveyed their ideas in picture language . FLETCHER , in his Cyclopedia of Education , says :— “ It has long been accepted as an axiom that the best explanation of a thing is the sight and study of the thing itself , and the next best a true picture of the thing . ” DRYDEN , speaking of poetry and painting says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The poets are confined to narrow space ,</l>
     <l n="2">To speak the language of their native place ;</l>
     <l n="3">The painter widely stretches his command ,</l>
     <l n="4">His pencil speaks the tongue of every land . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Many writers , ancient and modern , have taught the great educational power of pictures . HORACE says :— A picture is a poem without words ” . SYDNEY SMITH says :— “ Every good picture is the best of sermons and lectures . ” O. S. FOWLER says :— “ A single picture often conveys more than volumes . ” W. M. HUNT says :— “ From any picture we can learn something . ” HENRY WARD BEECHER says :— “ A picture that teaches any affection or moral sentiment will speak in the language which men understand , without any other education than that of being born and of living . ” GARRICK , speaking of Hogarth , says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ His pictured morals mend the mind ,</l>
     <l n="2">And through the eye improve the heart . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But pictures are not only a means of education , for they bring pleasure , comfort , and education combined . STEELE says :— “ Beautiful pictures are the entertainment of pure minds . ” G. P. PUTMAN says :— “ How many an eye and heart have been fascinated by an enchanting picture . ” CICERO says :— “ The eyes are charmed by pictures , and the ears by music . ” JOHN GILBERT says :— “ Pictures are consolers of loneliness ; they are a sweet flattery to the soul , they are a relief to the jaded mind ; they are windows to the imprisoned thought ; they are books , they are histories and sermons , which we can read without the trouble of turning over the leaves . ” UGO FOSCOLIO says :— “ Pictures are the chickweed to the gilded cage , and make up for the want of many other enjoyments to those whose life is mostly passed amid the smoke and din , the bustle and noise of an overcrowded city . ” PANDOLFINI says :— Many an eye has been surprised into moisture by pictured woe and heroism ; and we are mistaken if the glow of pleasure has not lighted in some hearts the flame of high resolve , or warmed into life the seeds of honorable ambition . ”</p>
   <p>Many pictures , particularly portraits , by bringing up reminiscences , are a great source of consolation . In millions of houses the most-loved and treasured possession is the photographic album containing the likenesses of dear absent or departed friends . SHEE , writing of the soothing influences of the portrait , says :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Mirror divine ! which gives the soul to view ,</l>
     <l n="2">Reflects the image , and retains it too !</l>
     <l n="3">Recalls to friendship 's eye the fading face ,</l>
     <l n="4">Revives each look , and rivals every grace :</l>
     <l n="5">In thee the banished lover finds relief ,</l>
     <l n="6">His bliss in absence , and his balm in grief :</l>
     <l n="7">Affection , grateful , owns thy sacred power ,</l>
     <l n="8">The father feels thee in affliction 's hour ;</l>
     <l n="9">When catching life ere some lov 'd cherub flies .</l>
     <l n="10">To take its angel station in the skies ,</l>
     <l n="11">The portrait soothes the loss it can n't repair ,</l>
     <l n="12">And sheds a comfort , even in despair . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Or —</l>
     <l n="14">“ The widow 'd husband sees his sainted wife</l>
     <l n="15">In pictures warm , and smiling as in life ,—</l>
     <l n="16">And —</l>
     <l n="17">While he gazes with convulsive thrill ,</l>
     <l n="18">And weeps , and wonders at the semblance still ,</l>
     <l n="19">He breathes a blessing on the pencil 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="20">That half restores the substance in the shade . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But it is more particularly with pictures as a direct means of education that I have to speak . MR. STEAD holds that in the coming education of the world the magic lantern will play a very great part , for through its aid you can portray any object you wish — pictures of scenery , of buildings , of distant countries , of the microscopic world , and in fact any kind of pictures you choose , in a most beautiful , life-like , interesting , and educational manner . I think and earnestly hope that MR. STEAD 'S prediction will be fulfilled .</p>
   <p>There are two other ways which I think that pictures should be used for educational purposes . Firstly , in books , as in this one , and secondly , on the walls of buildings — outside and inside if you like — but I will speak only of the inside in this paper . Why should not every room of every house be covered with pictures where it is not covered with furniture ? In millions of rooms there is a great waste of opportunity . Many times I have thought why do they not have varying patterns of different scenery , etc , in the different rooms of the houses instead of the wall paper , with its uninteresting pattern perpetually repeated . There is no reason why a house of twelve rooms should not represent on its walls twelve different countries , or twelve histories of striking events , etc . Possibly this may take place later on . With respect to hanging pictures everywhere on the walls , it may be objected that it would be too expensive — so it would if they were costly pictures — but really good pictures are produced by the million now so cheaply , that the objection of expense vanishes . The walls can be covered now almost as cheaply with intellectual pictures as with unintellectual wall paper . SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS says :— “ A room hung with pictures , is a room hung with thoughts . ” JOHN GILBERT says :— “ A room with pictures in it , and a room without pictures , differ by nearly as much as a room with windows and a room without windows ; for pictures are loopholes of escape to the soul , leading it to other scenes and to other spheres , as it were , through the frame of an exquisite picture , where the fancy for a moment may revel , refreshed and delighted . ”</p>
   <p>I was convinced many years ago of the almost criminal waste of wall space , and issued the following doggerel lines , partly from trade and partly from sentimental motives :—</p>

   <p>Even in the poorest houses pictures must always be a blessing . Many a poor man 's cheerless home would be made much more comfortable and endurable if a few shilling 's worth of good pictures were posted or hung round its bare walls . If houses were universally decorated with true speaking pictures what an immense influence for good it would bring them . What intellectual and refined tastes it would create and nurture . One most important thing in selecting pictures to cover the walls it to always choose good subjects . A poor picture takes up as much room as a good one , and generally costs as much . Always choose live speaking pictures that will interest and instruct . There is an immense multitude of poor , tame , an uninteresting pictures produced in the world , and which in millions of instances keep out the good ones . If these poor ones could be kept back or destroyed , and the best ones only take their place , the world would be better for it . In choosing materials to build up a bright , happy home , always select the best — the best books — the best music — the best pictures . In conclusion , there is one more suggestion I would make on the picture question , and I think it is the most important of all ; it is that a good clear map of the world should be hung in every house in the world , to give every person an idea of the world they live in . For it is a most deplorable fact that ninety-nine out of every hundred of the inhabitants , even of the civilized world , have a very poor conception of the geography and ethnology of the world . And this should not be , for every person ought to have a clear idea of their world-fatherland , and of their fellow creatures , and a knowledge of the map of the world is the first lesson to be learned in that most desirable direction .</p>

   <p>I have always been a man of one idea at a time , and that one idea I have followed with unwavering determination until success has rewarded my efforts . Now listen to my story :— A short time ago , much desiring to obtain a particular article , I determined to get it if it was possible to do so in this world , and so started on my search journey . I ran into Melbourne and asked</p>

He condescendingly said he did not know , but maybe the TIANG of Nankin could inform me ; I took a sailing wheelbarrow to the Centre of Wise Learning , saw the head</p>

I now said to myself I surely shall get the article I want from the vast resources of Her Majesty , but in answer to my query she politely remarked that she did not think I should get in her dominions , but was almost certain that I could get it from the CHIEF of the Greenland Esquimeaux , I rose up in</p>

   <figure>
    <p>Rowing Canoe .</p>

   <p>reached the Negro city , asked the Sheikh , he said it was like my impudence asking him , how should he know such a thing ? none of the traditions of the negro continent mentioned it , but if I thought such a thing existed I had better ask his Sublime Mightiness the SULTAN of Zanzibar , I jumped on the back of an ostrich , strode away to the</p>

No !— or the Swat of Ackoond , or the Mudor of Cassala , or the Hospodar of Wallachia , or the Aboona of Gondar or the Patriarch of Constantinople , or the Archbishop of Canterbury ? I said most decidedly not — that I would not waste my time consulting such insignificant magnates , then , says he , just you ask the GURO of the Sikhs . I jumped astride of a Bramah Bull , and</p>

I told him that I wanted to find out , but I thought there must be somewhere . Oh , then , said he , try the CHIEF RABBI of Jerusalem . I got into a coach , tore away to</p>

   <note>Page 113 — Forty Ways Of Travelling</note>
   <p>said that he had not got one and never heard of it ; but when I described to him , in clear , concise and glowing terms , the real value of the article to the whole human race , he said that every person black or white , or brown , or yellow , or red , or any other colour whatever , in the world , should have one and that it was the duty of all Kings and Queens and Emperors , and Sultans , and Czars , and Keizars , and Khedives and Khans , and Shahs , and Ameers , and Deys , and Beys , and Great Chams , and Grand Lamas , to see that every one of their subjects obtained one without delay . I said those were exactly my sentiments ; but where was it to be got . He again graciously assured me that he did not know , bit I might ask the GRAND MUFTI of Turkey , the fountain of all human knowledge , and custodian of the sacred Koran . I tore along in a goat-carriage , interviewed the head of</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Riding a Goat-Drawn Carriage .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>the Mahometan Faith ; but in answer to my query this Mighty Spiritual Magnate seemed taken aback ; he affirmed that the Koran did not mention the article , and , therefore , he believed that it could not exist , but had I made a thorough search for it ; had I tried the Dey of Algiers . I answered no ! Had I tried the Doge of Venice — the Elector of Saxony — the Begum of Oude — the Stadholder of Holland — the Peishwa of Poona — the Nabob of Bengal — the Caliph of Bagdad — the Inca of Peru , or the great Mogul . I looked at the Grand Mufti in speechless astonishment ; he might as well have asked me if I had enquired of Pharaoh or Nebuchadnezzer . I shook my head and rushed from his presence , completely nonplussed , bewildered , frantic . Where on earth was I to get the article ? I had asked , and asked , and asked again , and was tired of asking . I had travelled fifty thousand miles by forty different modes of conveyance ; consulted in their own capitals with thirty secular monarchs , governing three-fourths of the world ; and I had with earnest , respectful enquiry approached the sacerdotal thrones of the spiritual monarchs of the eleven principal religions of mankind , and yet I could get no tidings of it . What was I to do ? I was now standing in front of the great Mosque at Constantinople almost frantic with perplexity ; some one approached and handed me a printed announcement . I read it ! It sent an inexpressible thrill through me . I immediately took a steamer</p>

   </figure>
   <p>Arcade , and saw a drawing of the very article I had ransacked the world over to obtain , and what do you think it was ? It was a FLYING MACHINE ! I wanted a flying machine , Mr. Cole informed me that he had not got his machine to fly yet , and that in all the world a machine was not yet invented that would fly , but that , through the active and progressive ingenuity of the human intellect , such a machine was certain to be invented in the future , and as an earnest of his strong conviction he handed me a document , which ran as follows :—</p>
   <p>October 31st . 1882</p>
   <p>I , the undersigned , firmly believe that as man has already made machines to run over the land and float over the water faster than the swiftest animal , so shortly he will make machines to fly through the air as fast , and finally faster , than the swiftest birds do now . And I hereby offer a bonus of £ 1 , 000 to any person who shall ( in consequence of said bonus ) within the next two years invent a flying machine , to go by Electrical , Chemical , Mechanical , or any other means , except by gas , a distance of 100 miles , and shall come and stop in front of the Book Arcade , Bourke Street , Melbourne , Australia , as easily and as safely as a carriage stops there now .</p>

   <p>A workable flying machine would be the grandest invention of the age . My offer may not bring it about , but suppose a shilling subscription was made throughout the civilised world ; say twenty million people gave 1 / -  each . That would be one million pounds , and offer that as a bonus for a useful flying machine , that bonus , I am sure , would produce the article . The shillings would be well spent , and it would immortalise the twenty million people who put their names down .</p>

   <p>My prophecy with regard to flying machines , as may well be seen by the original statement herewith , was made twenty-eight years before the French aviator brought his machine to Australia which was on 2nd November , 1910 , or two weeks before his successful flight .</p>
   <p>Subsequently Mr. Hammond flew over the city . He remarked : “ I was to early for breakfast , and just thirty years too late to claim E. W. Cole 's prize of £ 1 , 000 . ”</p>
   <p>I believe that the advance of flying machines will be so rapid that within the next decade they will be used with as much ease and safety as any other means of present locomotion .</p>
   <p>I will further state that their utility will be so great as to enable China , with her three hundred millions , to succeed in taking correct statistics .</p>
   <p>And eventually the velocity with which they will fly may materially assist in establishing the peace of the world and the Parliament of Man .</p>
   <p>My prophecy with regard to flying machines was made in 1868 , and the bonus of £ 1 , 000 ( see previous page ) was offered in 1882 .</p>

   <p>Mr. Hawker was born at Brighton , Victoria , on 22nd January , 1889 . He went to England in 1911 , returning to Victoria in 1914 , after three years experience of aviation in England . He just missed the £ 5000 prize given by the “ Daily Mail ” for a flight around the British Isles , meeting with an accident off the coast of Ireland .</p>

   <p>It was Mr. E. W. Cole 's enthusiasm and belief in the ultimate success of aerial navigation that induced Miss Linda Cole to fly with Mr. Hawker , the daring young aviator , at Elsternwick recently . Miss Cole was perfectly calm and collected when entering the biplane , and showed no signs of “ nerviness . ” During the flight around St. Kilda , Brighton and Sandringham , and across the waters of Hobson 's Bay , she conversed freely with Mr. Hawker , and commented on the panoramic views which unfolded themselves below . Miss Cole , having heard that Mr. Hawker had some intention of flying on a non-stop journey from Sydney to Melbourne — a distance of 500 miles — was most anxious to accompany him , provided the Sopwith biplane would carry two persons in addition to the tank of petrol which would , of course , be indispensable . Mr. Hawker , however , says he would not take a passenger should he undertake the journey . Miss Cole is most anxious for another sea flight , as she is of opinion that the power to see through the water to the bottom of the ocean is one of the utmost importance , as it would , in warfare , enable aviators to locate with accuracy mines in harbours and any other submerged dangers . Her most ardent wish is to become a lady aviator , and she is contemplating a trip to Europe to obtain up-to-date instruction in the aerial art .</p>
   <p>The reason Miss Cole went up was because her father has always taken a great interest in aviation , and many years ago offered substantial prizes to constructors of airships . He has ever evinced great faith in the ultimate triumph of aerial navigation , and she is glad that his dreams are being realised . Miss Cole went up on Friday , on the thirteenth of the month . Friday and the number 13 are considered unlucky ; but all big events in her life have been associated with the number 13 .</p>

P.

   <p>To the Reader .— I beg to make one very important remark upon this immense variety of boy 's names , and that is :— Be sure and preserve the list carefully , as it will serve from which to choose names for your sons up to the number of 555 , without using the same name over again . P. S .— If you should be very , very lucky , and have more than 555 sons , and want more names , call on Professor Cole , at the Book Arcade , Melbourne , Australia , and he will give you an extra list .</p>

   <p>PROCLAMATION BY AUTHORITY .</p>
   <p>Be it known unto all of you that to find your own portrait and the fashion of your hat or bonnet , your Christian name and the Alphabet are used .</p>
   <p>The Alphabet is divided into four parts for the second letter of each person 's name as follows :— The letters A B C D E F belong to No . 1 portrait in each row , and in the case of the first of the letter A include such names as Abigail , Ada , Aaron , Abraham , Adolphus . The letters G H I J K L belong to the second portrait in each row , and in the case of the second portrait , of the letter A include such name as Agnes , Alice , Ahaz , Alfred . The letters M N O P Q R belong to the third portrait of each row , and in the case of the letter A include such names as Amy , Anna , Arabella , Amos , Andrew , Arthur . The letters S T U V W X Y Z belong to the fourth portrait in each row , and in the case of the letter A include such names as Athalia , Augusta , Asa , Augusta . The same rule is followed with each letter of the Alphabet : for instance , the first portrait in the row B belongs to such names as Barbara , Bessie , Bartholomew , Benjamin , and so on throughout the whole collection of portraits .</p>
   <p>If a woman is looking for her future husband , she must find the number of her own portrait and then the corresponding number amongst the men 's , and THAT IS TO BE HER HUSBAND : for instance , if her own portrait is No . 27 , No . 27 amongst the men 's is the portrait of her future darling . The same rule is to be followed by the men . If a man 's portrait is No . 93 , No . 93 amongst the ladies ’ IS TO BE HIS WIFE , his own future angel .</p>

   <p>If the persons who consult this oracle are single , the sweetheart that falls to their lot will be their first husband or wife , and if they are married it will be their second husband or wife , and if they have been married twice , it will be their third one , and so on up to 144 times of being married ; and after that no one will be allowed to consult this oracle , look at it , speak of it , or even think about it , such objectionable persons being entirely excluded from its benefits .</p>
   <p>Persons who consult this oracle must accept the husband or wife that falls to their lot just the same as if they married them in the usual way , but if dissatisfied on account of ugliness , dress , or any other cause the consulter , by doing penance in the shape of a pilgrimage to a certain place in the exact centre of the world and paying a small sum , can obtain a DIVORCE .</p>
   <p>The place to which the pilgrimage is to be made is Cole 's Book Arcade , Bourke Street , Melbourne , Australia , where they must buy a book of some kind , and that act DIVORCES them at once .</p>
   <p>Bashful persons need not mention their pilgrimage to the Book Arcade , when they purchase the book , unless they choose .</p>
   <p>Anyone having obtained a DIVORCE will be allowed to choose out of 9 other portraits . If the number of the portrait that fell to their lot was 8 , they can choose any other number ending with 8 , as 18 , 28 , 38 , 48 , 58 , 68 , 78 , 88 and 98 , of if their first number was 65 they can choose from 5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , 45 , 55 , 75 , 85 , 95 and so on ; whatever their number was , they may choose from the corresponding figures throughout the table .</p>
   <p>If , after making a choice out of the 9 portraits , anyone is still dissatisfied , by making 10 pilgrimages to the Book Arcade , or by buying and giving away 10 copies of this Funny Picture Book , they can claim the indulgence of a GRAND DIVORCE and choose which they like out of the whole 104 portraits .</p>
   <p>Given under our Royal hand and Seal at the Palace of the Book Arcade , this 21st day of November , 1890 .— COLE , REX .</p>

   <p>Popular Errors</p>
   <p>The commonly received notion that a man may marry his first cousin , but must not marry his second is not true ; but it is quite true that Cole 's Book Arcade is in Bourke Street , Melbourne , about half-way between Swanston and Elizabeth Sts . The rumour that a Yankee Gentleman had invented a machine to take the noise out of thunder has turned out not to be true ; but it is quite true that Cole 's Book Arcade is open from nine in the morning to ten at night , every working day in the year . The fact that Cole 's Book Arcade contains 80 , 000 sorts of books is not the cause of the sea being salt — of coca-nuts containing milk — of the growth of big gooseberries , nor of the multitude of great big fibs told annually about a sea-serpent . It is not true that cats will suck the breath of children when they are asleep , but it is quite true that Cole 's Book Arcade contains one interesting cat and 80 , 000 sorts of interesting books .

   <note>Page 147 — Kindness To Animals</note>
   <p>Kindness To Animals</p>
   <p>Power of Kindness to Animals</p>
   <p>Thousands of pathetic tales could be told of the sufferings of poor dumb animals and the sympathy of some kind human souls for them . The following one is from the Secretary of a Humane Society :—</p>
   <p>The wife of a small country farmer wrote to me : “ I can n't bear sending the cattle to market . I always keep out of the way , for every animal on the place knows me , and they look at me so sadly , and , knowing what they 're going to , I feel sometimes that I 'd rather give the whole thing up , than go on rearing them to be knocked about and killed .</p>
   <p>“ I went to the market once myself to see a young beast being sold , but I 'll never go again . I had fed it with my own hands every day , till it was like a child . I went to the market-town by train , and the young bullock was driven by road . I walked a little way out to meet it , and at last met it coming tramping along , and the drover told me he had had the greatest difficulty to get it along the last few miles ; it had become so tired . You see it had not had much exercise , as when you are fattening things , it does not do to let them run about too much , or they 'll ‘ run all the meat off their bones ’ again , as the saying is .</p>
   <p>“ When I went to Smithfield , I was ready to faint as I saw the men shouting and swearing , and slashing away with thick sticks . The poor things were so confused and knocked about that they did n't know what to do , and I went up to the man who seemed to be in charge of the pens that our auctioneer was going to sell from , and asked him if he would be kind to my poor bullock when it came . He only cursed it an laughed a mocking laugh , and said , ‘ Oh , yes , —— it , I 'll be gentle with it . You wait , missis , and see ! Do you think I 'm here to coddle any —— beasts ? If you do , you 're —— well mistaken . ’</p>
   <p>“ I could n't bear to see what would happen . I could n't stand it , so I went away , and then the men ( dealers ) simply stood and talked , and haggled with the farmers ; and the drovers shouted and yelled , and hooted , and knocked the things about , and hit them on the nose and over the eyes , and poked and prodded them with sharp pointed sticks ; and the dogs yapped and barked , and I never heard a single word of pity , or saw a sign of pity for the poor , tired , bruised , panting , and terrified creatures .</p>
   <p>“ It was a terribly hot day , and I wandered about the town all the afternoon , able to think of little else than of my poor bullock , and of what had become of it , when , as I was going to the station to my train , I met three or four cattle coming driven along . Suddenly one of them caught sight of me , and in spite of all the men could do came rushing up towards me . It was my poor bullock ; but , oh , so terribly altered . I should hardly have known it .</p>
   <p>“ It seemed beside itself with joy to see me , and stood by me lowing so pitifully , as much as to say , ‘ Oh , I 'm so glad I 've found you ! I know I 'm safe now , and you wo n't let these awful men carry me off again ’ .</p>
   <p>“ At last they managed to get it to move on by flogging it savagely , and , heart-sick and conscience-smitten , I went to the station ; and when I got the money that it was sold for it seemed to me like ‘ the price of blood . ’ But what can I do ?</p>
   <p>“ I suppose the proper thing is to get hardened and to think nothing about it , like other people ; but it is so dreadful that I can never go to market to see another of my poor beasts sold . ”</p>
   <p>Kind Miss Cobbe</p>
   <p>Miss Frances Power Cobbe gave herself , heart and soul , to the defence of the animals , not because she loved them more than human beings but because she could not bear to see the men acting so wickedly towards them , nor to hear the groans of the helpless victims .</p>
   <p>In the account of her life , written by herself , she says : “ It is not the four legs nor the silky or shaggy coat of a dog which should prevent us from discerning his inner nature of thought and love ; limited thought , it is true , but an unlimited love . That he is dumb , is to me only another claim ( as it would be in a human child ) on my consideration ... Another dog , whom I sent away at one year old to live in the country , was returned to me eight years afterwards old and diseased . The poor beast knew me again after a few moments ’ eager examination , and uttered an actual scream of joy when I called her by name , exhibiting every token of tender affection for me ever afterwards . ”</p>
   <p>In her books entitled “ Dogs whom I Have Met , ” she says : “ The dog who really loves his master delights in mere propinquity , likes to lie down on the floor resting against his feet , better than on a cushion a yard away , and after a warm interchange of caresses for two or three minutes asks no more , and subsides into perfect contentment . That a short tender touch of the dog 's tongue to hand or face corresponds exactly , as an expression of his feelings , to our kisses of affection , there can be no sort of doubt . All dogs kiss the people they love . ”</p>
   <p>Tennyson , when on a visit to Miss Cobbe , bade her go bravely on as she had begun , and “ fight the good fight , ” by which he meant the warfare against cruelty in which she was engaged . After his death it was sad to hear the wail of three dogs , a collie , a Scotch terrier , and a Russian wolf-hound , constant companions and friends of the poet . Thousands of dogs have pined , and died of grief , for their loved masters .</p>
   <p>At a Bull Fight</p>
   <p>The following is a pathetic narrative entitled “ El Moro . ”</p>
   <p>A Cadiz letter says : “ Notice had been posted on all the public places that on a certain day the bull called ‘ El Moro ’ would be introduced into the arena , and that , when he should have been goaded to the utmost fury , a young girl would appear and reduce the animal to quiet subjection . The people of Cadiz had heard of ‘ El Moro ’ as the most magnificent bull ever brought into the city , and it soon became known that the girl just advertised was a peasant girl of Espara , who had petted the bull , and fed it and cared for it during the years of it 's growth . On the appointed day the vast amphitheatre was filled with an anxious , eager crowd . Several bulls had been killed and dragged away , and then the flourish of trumpets announced the coming of the hero of the day . With a deep , terrific roar , ‘ El Moro ’ entered upon the scene . He was truly magnificent ; a bovine monarch , black and glossy , with eyes of fire , dilating nostrils , and wicked-looking horns . The picadores attacked him warily , hurling their banderillos ( small , dart-like javelins ornamented with ribbons , and intended to jade and infuriate ) . The bull had killed three horses offhand , and had received eight banderillos in his neck and shoulders , when , upon a given signal , the picadores and matadores suddenly withdrew leaving the infuriated beast alone in his wild paroxysm of wrath . Presently a soft musical note , like the piping of a lark , was heard , and directly afterwards a girl of not more than fifteen years of age , an the tasteful garb of an Andalusian peasant , and with a pretty face , sprang lightly into the arena , approaching the bull fearlessly , at the same time calling his name — ‘ Moro ! Moro ! Va voy ! ’ At the first sound of the sweet voice the animal ceased his fury , and turned towards the place whence it came , and , when he saw the girl , he plainly manifested pleasure . She came to his head , and put forth her hand , which he licked with his tongue . Then she sang a low , sweet song , at the same time caressing the animal by patting him on the forehead , and , while she sang , the suffering monarch kneeled at her feet . Then she stooped and gently removed the cruel banderillos , after which , with her arms around ‘ El Moro 's ’ neck , she led him towards the gate of the torril . ”</p>

   <p>Kangaroo</p>
   <p>The Kangaroo is the largest native animal in Australia . He is about 5 feet high when he sits up , he has a head somewhat like a rabbit 's , his hands or fore feet are small but his hind feet are large , and he has a very thick tail . He can kick and tear with his sharp hind claws in a very dangerous manner . He frequently kills dogs with his claws , but , when he is chased by dogs , if he is near water he makes for it and often drowns the dogs if they come into the water after him . He leaps or hops about 15 feet at a time and goes very fast . The mother carries her young in a pouch , as seen in the picture , and when the baby kangaroos are frightened they run at once into their mother 's pouch for safety , like any other babies running to their mother .</p>

   <p>Australian Native Cat</p>
   <p>It is a wild Cat , generally brown or black with many large and small white spots on it . It lives on small animals , including birds and their eggs , and is a great pest to farmers , killing their poultry .</p>

   <p>Emu</p>
   <p>The Emu lives upon vegetable food such as fruits , roots , and grass . It has a great curiosity and is easily tamed . It is very inoffensive except when violently attacked ; then it kicks like a horse . It is said that its kick will break a man 's leg . Its flesh is eaten by the natives and is said to look and taste like beef . It can run very fast . It lays from 6 to 12 dark green coloured eggs and its young are pretty little striped things as in the above picture . It is , next to the Ostrich , the largest bird in the world , being 5 or 6 feet high , its colour is a mixture of grey and brown , and its voice has a low booming sound . It is generally coupled with the Kangaroo in the Australian Arms .</p>

   <p>Platypus</p>
   <p>The Platypus is sometimes called the Water Mole . It is , perhaps , the most wonderful animal in the world in its combination , being part bird , part beast , part fish . It has a bill like a duck ; five toes with claws and webbed feet ; it is covered with thick glossy fur like a seal ; it has cheek pouches like a monkey to keep it 's food in ; it lays two eggs , its voice resembles that of a young puppy , and the young platypuses play like puppies ; it lives in rivers and makes burrows often 20 or 30 feet long ; it feeds upon water insects , shell fish , etc .</p>

   <p>Native Bear</p>
   <p>The Australian Native Bear is a dear little harmless fellow , and is easily tamed . He lives in the gum trees , feeds upon gum leaves , and loves his mother who carries him on her back and is very fond of him . He has a thick fluffy coat , big bushy ears , and no tail . He cries like a child if he misses his mother . The cry very pathetically if they are wounded , which they frequently are in the bush , by cruel wicked boys and men who think it is sport to shoot at the poor harmless creatures .</p>

   <p>Bower Bird</p>
   <p>The Australian Bower Bird is an extensive builder ; it not only builds its nest in a tree but it builds a palace on the ground in the shape of a bower hut , furnishes it with nick-nacks such as shells , bones , pieces of mineral , metals , bright parrots ’ feathers and other trifles . What the English magpie would steal and hide away the Bower Bird openly decorates his pavilion with . Often several birds collect together and play like children , running in , out , and around their wonderful bower-palace as shown in our picture .</p>
   <p>Lyre Bird</p>
   <p>The Australian Lyre Bird is a most beautiful creature , said to be a variety of the Bird of Paradise . It runs very quickly , and springs very high , and calls very loudly . It lays but one egg a year and , consequently , only has one baby per annum . It is a great mimic . Mr. Metcalfe in his “ Australian Zoology ” , describing it , says : “ It is a consummate mimic and ventriloquist . It imitates to perfection the notes of all other birds , the united voices of a flock of parrakeets , the barking of dogs , the sawing of timber and the clink of the woodman 's axe . This it has earned for itself the title of the Australian Mocking Bird . ”</p>

     <l n="62">Says Ponto to Puss , “ The mouse is my friend ,</l>
     <l n="63">And if you would hurt her , why I must defend</l>
     <l n="64">That nice little , kind little , good little mouse ,</l>
     <l n="65">As long as she ever remains in this house . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">

   <p>So the nice little mouse , the dog and the cat , all three ate together , and slept on the mat ; They sung , danc 'd and romp 'd with joy and merry laughter , And as the old take says , “ Lived happy ever after . ”</p>

   <p>History of Mr. Tom Puss And The Rats</p>
   <p>Mrs. Puss stayed at home , minded and played with young Master John Puss , Miss Mary Puss , and Baby Puss , while Mr. Puss went out to get them something to eat . He went into a barn , tied a piece of cheese to the tip of his tail , and put it through a hole in a door , thinking that he would catch a rat that way . Some very knowing rats on the other side of the door got a piece of string , tied it to his tail , pulled all together , and made Mr. Puss me-ow very loud , and he found that instead of his catching a rat , the rats had caught him . Mrs. Puss , finding that Mr. Puss did not come home , put little John Puss and Mary Puss to bed without any supper , and then sang little deaf Baby Puss off to sleep by means of the ear trumpet . The rats ate their supper off Mr. Puss 's tail , and then let him go . You see what a fine long tail he had when he put it through the hole to catch rats in that foolish manner ; and look at his short tail now , in the corner of the page .</p>

   <p>Puss In Boots</p>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons . When he was dying he left each of them a legacy . To his eldest son he left his mill ; to his second his ass ; and to his youngest his cat . The poor boy was very sad when he found that he had nothing belonging to him but a cat ; but , to his great surprise , puss jumped on the table and said in a friendly manner : “ Do not be sad , my dear master , only buy me a pair of boots and a bag and I 'll provide for you and myself . ” So the miller 's son , who had a shilling or two in his pocket , bought a smart little pair of boots and a bag , and gave them to puss , who put some bran and sow-thistles into his bag , opened the mouth of it , and lay down in a rabbit warren . A foolish young rabbit jumped into it ; puss drew the string and soon killed it . He went immediately to the palace with it . He found the king and queen sitting on the throne , and , bowing low , he laid the rabbit at the king 's feet , saying : “ Please , your majesty , my master , the Marquis de Carabas , has sent you a rabbit from his warren , as a mark of respect . ” “ I am much obliged to the Marquis , ” said the king , and he ordered the rabbit to be taken to the cook , and a piece of money to be given to the cat .</p>
   <p>During two or three months the cat continued to carry game every now and then to the king , which was supposed to be the produce of his master 's sport . One day when he happened to hear the king was going to take a drive on the banks of the river , in company with his daughter , who was the most beautiful princess in the world , puss desired the master to go and bathe in the river at the spot that he should point out , and leave the rest to him . The Marquis of Carabas did as his cat advised him . Just as he was bathing the king came past , when the cat bawled out as loud as he could — “ Help ! help ! or the Marquis of Carabas will be drowned ! ” On hearing this , the king looked out of the carriage window , and recognising the cat , ordered his bodyguards to fly to the assistance of my Lord Marquis of Carabas . As the poor Marquis was being fished out of the river , the cat informed his majesty that , while his master was bathing , some robbers had stolen his clothes . The king immediately ordered the gentlemen of his wardrobe to fetch one of his most sumptuous dresses . No sooner had this been done and the Marquis suitably attired , then he looked to such advantage that the king took him to be a very fine gentleman ; while the princess was so struck with his appearance , that at once she became head and ears in love with him .</p>
   <p>The king insisted that the Marquis should get into the carriage . The cat , highly delighted at the turn thinks were taking , now ran on before , and having reached a meadow where there were some peasants , he thus accosted them ; “ I say , good folks , if you do not tell the king that this field belongs to the Marquis of Carabas , you shall all be chopped as fine as mince-meat . ” The king did not fail to inquire of the peasants to whom the meadow belonged ? “ To the Marquis of Carabas , please your majesty , ” said they in a breath .</p>
   <p>And the cat kept running on before the carriage , and repeating the same instructions to all the labourers he met with , so that the king was astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of Carabas .</p>
   <p>At length the cat reached a magnificent castle belonging to a giant who was immensely rich . The cat having inquired what sort of person the giant might be , and what he was able to do , sent in a message to request leave to speak with him .</p>
   <p>The giant received him civilly . “ I have been told , ” said the cat , “ that you have the power of transforming yourself into all sorts of animals . ” “ So I have , ” replied the giant , “ and to prove the truth of what I say you shall see me become a lion . ” When the cat beheld a lion standing before him , and saw the monster quietly light his pipe , he was seized with such a panic that he clambered up to the roof . After a time , the cat perceiving that the giant had returned to his natural shape , came down again .</p>
   <p>“ And do you possess the power of assuming the shape of the smallest animals likewise ? ” “ You shall see ; ” and the giant immediately assumed the shape of a mouse , when the cat pounced upon him and ate him up .</p>
   <p>By this time the king had reached the gates of the Giant 's magnificent castle , and expressed a wish to enter so splendid a building . The cat ran out to meet the king , saying — “ Your majesty is welcome to the Marquis of Carabas 's castle . ”</p>
   <p>The king was so delighted with the Marquis of Carabas , that he accepted him as a son-in-law , and that very same day he was married to the princess .</p>
   <p>The cat became a great lord , and ever after hunted mice only for his own amusement .</p>

    <p>Two Cats , a Scale and a Monkey .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Monkey And The Cats</p>
   <p>Two hungry cats having stolen some cheese , could not agree between themselves how to divide their booty ; therefore they went to the law , and a cunning monkey was to decide their case .</p>
   <p>“ Let us see , ” said the judge ( with as arch a look as could be ) ; “ ay , ay , this slice truly outweighs the other ; ” and with this he bit off a large piece , on order , as he told them , to make a fair balance .</p>
   <p>The other scale had now become too heavy , which gave this upright judge a pretence to make free with a second mouthful .</p>
   <p>“ Hold , hold ! ” cried the two cats ; give each of us our share of what is left and we will be content .</p>
   <p>“ If you are content , ” said the monkey , “ justice is not ; the law , my friends , must have it 's course . ”</p>
   <p>Upon this he nibbled first one piece and then the other , till the poor cats , seeing their cheese in a fair way to be all eaten up , most humbly begged him not to put himself to any further trouble , to give them what still remained .</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ha ! ha ! not so fast , I beseech you , good ladies , ” said the monkey ; “ we owe justice to ourselves as well as to you : and what remains is due to me as the lawyer . ” Upon this he crammed the whole into his mouth at once , and very gravely broke up the court .</p>
   <p>This fable teaches us that it is better to put up with a trifling loss , than to run the risk of losing all we have by going to the law .</p>
   <p>Dick Whittington And His Cat</p>
   <p>There was once a Lord Mayor of London , whose name was Sir Richard Whittington . He rose to that office from being a poor orphan , living in a distant village . Dick was a sharp boy , and was always picking up knowledge from some of the villagers . Dick heard of the great City of London ; he often heard it said that the streets were paved all over with gold .</p>
   <p>One day seeing a waggon and team of horses on the road to London ; he took courage and asked the waggoner to let him walk by his side . Having gained permission , they set off together . When Dick got to London , he was very eager to see the fine streets paved all over with gold , but the poor boy saw nothing but dirt instead of gold , so he crouched down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren , a great merchant . Here he was soon found by an ill-tempered cook , who ordered him to go about his business . But just at this moment Mr. Fitzwarren himself came home , and finding that the poor boy was willing to work , he took him into his house , and said that he should be kept to do what dirty work he was able for the cook . The cook was always scolding him from morning till night , and was very cruel to him . Poor Dick had another hardship . His bed was places in a garret where there were great numbers of rats and mice , which ran over his face , and made a great noise . Dick at last bought a cat which was famous for being an excellent mouser .</p>
   <p>Soon after this , the merchant , who had a ship ready to sail , asked his servants if they would send any goods abroad . All the servants mentioned something they were willing to venture but poor Whittington , who said he had nothing but a cat which was his companion .</p>
   <p>“ Fetch thy cat , boy , ” said Mr. Fitzwarren , “ and let her go . ” Dick hesitated for some time ; at last he brought poor Puss , and delivered her to the captain with tears in his eyes . The cook continued to be so cruel to him that the unhappy fellow determined to leave his place . He accordingly packed up his few things , and travelled as far as Holloway , and there sat down on a stone . While he was there musing , Bow-bells began to ring ; and it seemed to him that their sound said :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Turn again , Whittington ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lord Mayor of London . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">So back went Dick , and got into the house before the cook came down</l>
     <l n="4">stairs .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The ship with Dick 's cat on board happened to be driven by contrary winds on a part of the coast of Barbary , inhabited by Moors , who showed great eagerness to purchase the things with which the ship was laden . The captain seeing this , took patterns of the choicest articles he had to the King of the Moors . While he was showing them to him , dinner was brought in , and at once lots of rats and mice came in and ate up all the dainties . The captain was astonished when the King told him that this often happened . The captain rushed off at once to the ship , and brought Puss to the palace . The second dinner had been brought in , and , as usual , in came the rats and mice ; Pussy at the sight of them sprang out of the captain 's arms and killed lots of them , and the rest ran off to their holes . The King was greatly pleased with the wonderful Puss , and gave two sackfuls of gold for the cat , and the captain at once sailed for London . When Mr. Fitzwarren heard the news , he ordered Dick Whittington to be called , and showed him all the riches which the captain had brought in exchange for his cat . Dick was now a rich man , and soon after married the merchant 's daughter , at the very church whose bells seemed to call him back to London . He grew richer and richer , became Sheriff , and at length Lord Mayor of London .</p>

   <p>I have been blamed for printing and distributing “ Mother Hubbard . ” My answer is :— “ Old Mother Hubbard ” has done more towards the education of young children than perhaps any piece of reading in existence . Amongst the hundreds of millions of English speaking people in all parts of the earth , there are very few but can repeat a part or the whole of “ Mother Hubbard , ” and I have seen it somewhat asserted that it is to be found in almost every home in the civilised world . Its rude style of poetry tells nothing against it . The child knows nothing of correct metre : as long as there is a jingling rhyme it is satisfied . The dog is the domestic animal in millions of families , and in numberless cases is actually a more loved companion then brothers and sisters . A simple rhyme , therefore , about this attached , playful , and constant companion is sure to fascinate the young , and it has fascinated more than a thousand millions of the little dears . I firmly believe that it would produce grand results if a pretty illustrated edition of the principal nursery rhymes were made a text-book in infant schools . You may try , and try , and try again , to drive an ordinary dry school-book lesson into the infant mind , and make very little progress — it is up-hill work . But take an illustrated edition of a nursery rhyme , say the “ Death of Cock Robin , ” or “ Mother Hubbard , ” and call the little one to you , begin to teach it — how eagerly , how intently does it begin to learn now ! What animation in its little eyes ! What music in its little , joyous , interested voice ! It learns this lesson ten times as fast as the other one , and gives you ten times the pleasure in teaching it , and this kind of teaching gradually and insensibly leads the child into a love of learning : it interests and sets the young inquiring mind at work . We all know how much easier it is to do a work we are interested in than a work we are not . It is just so with the child , and for that reason I would commence to teach the infant mind with that which pleased it best , and so gradually create a love for reading . For years I have allowed numbers of little children , of their own accord , to stand and read nursery rhymes to themselves , and to teach other youths to read interesting and instructive fiction , gratis , in the Book Arcade ; and I hold that , by its enticingly creating a love for reading , which will lead to something higher , time is one of the best and most effective schools in the country .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="95">
     <l n="473">Once on a time , a shepherd lived</l>
     <l n="474">Within a cottage small ;</l>
     <l n="475">The grey thatched roof was shaded by</l>
     <l n="476">An elm-tree dark and tall ;</l>
     <l n="477">While all around , stretched far away ,</l>
     <l n="478">A wild and lonesome moor ,</l>
     <l n="479">Except a little daisied field</l>
     <l n="480">Before the trellised door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="96">
     <l n="481">Now , it was on a cold March day ,</l>
     <l n="482">When on the moorland wide</l>
     <l n="483">The shepherd found a trembling lamb</l>
     <l n="484">By its mother 's side ;</l>
     <l n="485">And so pitiful it bleated ,</l>
     <l n="486">As with the cold it shook ,</l>
     <l n="487">He wrapped it up beneath his coat ,</l>
     <l n="488">And home the poor lamb took .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="97">
     <l n="489">He placed it by the warm fireside ,</l>
     <l n="490">And then his children fed</l>
     <l n="491">This little lamb , whose mother died ,</l>
     <l n="492">With milk and sweet brown bread ,</l>
     <l n="493">Until it ran about the floor ,</l>
     <l n="494">Or at the door would stand ;</l>
     <l n="495">And grew so tame , it ate its food</l>
     <l n="496">From out the children 's hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="98">
     <l n="497">It followed them where'er they went ,</l>
     <l n="498">Came ever at their call ,</l>
     <l n="499">And dearly was this pretty lamb</l>
     <l n="500">Beloved by them all .</l>
     <l n="501">And often on a market-day ,</l>
     <l n="502">When cotters crossed the moor ,</l>
     <l n="503">They stopped to praise the snow-white lamb ,</l>
     <l n="504">Beside the cottage door ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="99">
     <l n="505">They patted it upon its head ,</l>
     <l n="506">And stroked it with the hand ,</l>
     <l n="507">And vowed it was the prettiest lamb</l>
     <l n="508">They 'd seen in all the land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="100">
     <l n="509">Now , this kind shepherd was as ill ,</l>
     <l n="510">As ill as he could be ,</l>
     <l n="511">And kept his bed for many a week ,</l>
     <l n="512">And nothing earned he ;</l>
     <l n="513">And when he had got well again ,</l>
     <l n="514">He to his wife did say ,</l>
     <l n="515">“ The doctor wants his money , and</l>
     <l n="516">I have n't it to pay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="101">
     <l n="517">“ What shall we do , what can we do ?</l>
     <l n="518">The doctor made me well ,</l>
     <l n="519">There 's only one thing can be done ,</l>
     <l n="520">We must the pet lamb sell ;</l>
     <l n="521">We 've nearly eaten all the bread ,</l>
     <l n="522">And how can we get more ,</l>
     <l n="523">Unless you call the butcher in</l>
     <l n="524">When he rides by the door ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="102">
     <l n="525">“ Oh , do not sell my white pet lamb , ”</l>
     <l n="526">Then little Mary said ,</l>
     <l n="527">“ And every night I 'll go up stairs</l>
     <l n="528">Without my tea to bed ;</l>
     <l n="529">Oh ! do not sell my sweet pet lamb ;</l>
     <l n="530">And if you let it live ,</l>
     <l n="531">The best half of my bread and milk</l>
     <l n="532">I will unto it give . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="103">
     <l n="533">The doctor at that very time</l>
     <l n="534">Entered the cottage door ,</l>
     <l n="535">As , with her arms around her lamb ,</l>
     <l n="536">She sat upon the floor .</l>
     <l n="537">“ For if the butcher buys my lamb ,</l>
     <l n="538">He 'll take away its life ,</l>
     <l n="539">And make its pretty white throat bleed</l>
     <l n="540">With his sharp cruel knife ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="104">
     <l n="541">“ And never in the morning light</l>
     <l n="542">Again it will me meet ,</l>
     <l n="543">Nor come again to lick my hand ,</l>
     <l n="544">Look up upon me and bleat . ”</l>
     <l n="545">“ Why do you weep , my pretty girl ? ”</l>
     <l n="546">The doctor then did say .</l>
     <l n="547">“ Because I love my little lamb ,</l>
     <l n="548">Which must be sold to-day ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="105">
     <l n="549">It lies beside my bed at night ,</l>
     <l n="550">And , oh , it is so still ,</l>
     <l n="551">It never made a bit of noise</l>
     <l n="552">When father was so ill .</l>
     <l n="553">“ Oh do not let them sell my lamb ,</l>
     <l n="554">And then I 'll go to bed ,</l>
     <l n="555">And never ask for aught to eat</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="106">
     <l n="556">But a small piece of bread . ”</l>
     <l n="557">“ I 'll buy the lamb and give it you , ”</l>
     <l n="558">The kind , good doctor said ,</l>
     <l n="559">“ And with the money that I pay</l>
     <l n="560">Your father can buy bread .</l>
     <l n="561">“ As for the bill , that can remain</l>
     <l n="562">Until another year . ”</l>
     <l n="563">He paid the money down , and said ,</l>
     <l n="564">“ The lamb is yours , my dear :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="107">
     <l n="565">You have a kind and gentle heart ,</l>
     <l n="566">And God , who made us all ,</l>
     <l n="567">He loveth well those who are kind</l>
     <l n="568">To creatures great and small ;</l>
     <l n="569">“ And while I live , my little girl ,</l>
     <l n="570">Your lamb shall not be sold ,</l>
     <l n="571">But play with you upon the moor ,</l>
     <l n="572">And sleep within the fold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="108">
     <l n="573">And so the white pet lamb was saved ,</l>
     <l n="574">And played upon the moor ,</l>
     <l n="575">And after little Mary ran</l>
     <l n="576">About the cottage-floor .</l>
     <l n="577">It fed upon cowslips tall ,</l>
     <l n="578">And ate the grass so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="579">And on the little garden-walk</l>
     <l n="580">Pattered its pretty feet ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="109">
     <l n="581">And with its head upon her lap</l>
     <l n="582">The little lamb would lay</l>
     <l n="583">Asleep beneath the elm-tree 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="584">Upon the summer 's day ,</l>
     <l n="585">While she twined the flowers around its neck ,</l>
     <l n="586">And called it her , “ Sweet May . ”</l>

   <p>But the haymakers said to her , “ If you will go and fetch us a bucket of water , we 'll give you the hay . ” So away the old woman went ; but she found the bucket was full of holes . So she covered the bottom with pebbles , and then filled the bucket with water , and away she went back with it to the haymakers ; and they gave her a wisp of hay .</p>
   <p>As soon as the cow had eaten the hay , she gave the old woman the milk ; and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat . As soon as the cat had drank the milk , the cat began to kill the rat , the rat began to gnaw the rope , the rope began to hang the butcher , the butcher began to kill the ox , the ox began to drink the water , the water began to quench the fire , the fire began to burn the stick , the stick began to beat the dog , the dog began to bite to pig , the pig in a great fright jumped over the stile , and so the old woman got home that night in time to boil some apple dumplings for her husband 's supper .</p>

     <l n="5">The Story of the Three Little Pigs</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Once there was an old pig , who had three little pigs , and sent them out to seek their fortune . The first one went and built a house with straw , and soon after a wolf came and knocked at the door and said , “ Little pig , let me come in . ” But the little pig said , “ No , no by the hair of my chin . ” The wolf then said , “ I 'll huff , and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house in . ” So he huffed , and he puffed , and blew the house in , and ate up the little pig .</p>
   <p>The next little pig built a house with sticks , and the old wolf came along and called out , “ Little pig , let me come in . ” And the little pig answered , “ No , no , by the hair of my chin . ” “ Then , ” says the wolf , “ I 'll huff , and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house in . ” So he huffed and he puffed , and blew the house down , and ate up the little pig also .</p>
   <p>The third little pig built a house with bricks . Just after along came the old wolf , and said , “ Little pig , let me come in . ” The little pig said , “ No , no , by the hair of my chin . ” “ Then I 'll huff and I 'll puff , and I 'll blow your house down . ” Well , he huffed and he puffed , and he huffed and he puffed , and he puffed and he huffed ; but he could not get the house down .</p>
   <p>When he found he could not , with all his huffing and puffing , blow the house down , he said “ Little pig , I know where there is a nice field of turnips . ” “ Where ? ” said the little pig . “ Oh , in Mr. Smith 's home field , and if you will be ready to-morrow morning I will call for you , and we will go together , and get some for dinner . ”</p>
   <p>“ Very well , ” said the little pig , “ I will be ready . What time do you mean to go ? ” “ Oh , at six o'clock . ” Well , the little pig got up at five , and got the turnips before the wolf came , which he did about six , and said , “ Little pig , are you ready ? ” The little pig said , “ Ready ; I 've been and come back again and got a nice potful for dinner . ”</p>
   <p>The wolf felt very angry at this , but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other , so he said , “ Little pig , I know where there is a nice apple tree . ” “ Where ? ” said the little pig . “ Down at Merry Garden , ” replied the wolf , “ and if you will not deceive me I will come for you at five o'clock tohYpppHeNmorrow , and we will go together and get some apples . ”</p>
   <p>Well , the pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock , and went off for the apples , hoping to get back before the wolf came ; but he had further to go , and had to climb the tree , so that just as he was coming down from it he saw the wolf coming , which , as you may suppose , frightened him very much . When the wolf came up he said , “ Little pig , what ; are you here before me ? Are they nice apples ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , very , ” said the little pig , “ I will throw you down one . ” And he threw it so far that , while the wolf was gone to pick it up , the little pig jumped down and ran home . The next day the wolf came again , and said “ Little pig , there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon , will you go ? ” Oh , yes , ” said the pig , “ I will go : what time shall you be ready ? ” “ At three , ” said the wolf .</p>
   <p>So the little pig went off before the time as usual , got to the fair , and bought a butter-churn , which he was going home with , when he saw the wolf coming . Then he could not tell what to do . So he got into the churn to hide , and by doing so turned it around , and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it , which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair . He went to the little pig 's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him .</p>
   <p>Then the little pig said “ Ha ! I frightened you , then . I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn , and when I saw you I got into it and rolled down the hill . ” Then the wolf was very angry indeed , and declared he would eat up the little pig , and that he would get down the chimney after him .</p>
   <p>When the little pig saw what he was about , he hung onto the pot full of water , and made up a blazing fire , and just as the wolf was coming down , took off the cover , and in fell the wolf ; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant , boiled him up , and ate him for supper , and lived happy ever afterwards .</p>

     <l n="184">Laughter as a Medicine .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The physician tells us of the physical benefits of laughing . There is not the remotest corner or little inlet of the minute blood-vessels of the human body that does not feel some wavelet from the convulsion occasioned by good hearty laughter . The life principle , or the central man , is shaken to the innermost depths , sending new tided of life and strength to the surface , thus materially tending to insure good health to persons who indulge therein . The blood moves more rapidly , and conveys a different impression to all the organs of the body , as it visits them on that particular mystic journey when the man is laughing , from what it does at other times . For this reason every good , hearty laugh in which a person indulges lengthens his life , conveying as it does a new and distinct stimulus to the vital forces . ”</p>
   <p>“ Fun is worth more than physic , and whoever invents or discovers a new supply deserves the name of public benefactor . ”</p>
   <p>Man Made to Laugh , not to Morn .</p>
   <p>Man warnt made tew mourn , man waz made tew laff . He iz the onla creeter or thing that God made tew laff out loud . It iz true he knows how to mourn , do duz animills know how , the birds kan tell their sorrows , and the flowers kan hang their pretty heds . Man was made tew smile , tew laff , to haw ! tew throw up his hat , and sing halleluger . Man was made tew praze God , and he can n't dew it by mourning . Awl the mourning there iz in this wurld was introduced bi man ; man warnt made tew mourn any more than he was made to crawl . Tharfore i sa tew awl men and women , stop crying and go tew laffing , you will last longer , and git fatter , and stand just as good a chanse tew git tew heaven with a smile on your countenance as yu will with yure face leaking at every pore .— Josh Billings</p>
   <p>Josh Billing 's Prayer .</p>
   <p>“ From a wife who do n't luv us , from fluky mutton , and tite butes , and from folks who wo n't laff , good Lord deliver us . ”</p>

   <p>Most Astonishing Cure of the Age</p>
   <p>Dear Sir — Many years ago it was my misfortune to be jilted in love by a cruel-hearted woman . I pined away , and fell into a bad state of health , and was advised by my friends to take some physic . I never took a single dose except somebody told me that it was exactly what I wanted to make me well — but it all did me no good . I only got worse until I came across the right thing , which I will presently describe . I find , in looking over my paid bills , the following are the kinds and quantities of physic I have used during my illness :— Holloway 's Pills , 227 boxes ; Cockle 's Pills , 121 boxes , Beecham 's Pills , 80 boxes ; Parr 's Life Pills , 76 boxes , Blue Pills , 849 boxes . One friend advised me to give up Pills and take some good old-fashioned physic . I took of Jalap , 37 pounds ; Caster Oil ; 180 bottles , Salts and Senna , 800 doses ; Rhubarb and Magnesia , 300 doses ; Brimstone and Treacle , 800 doses — but this did me no good . Another friend advised me to take some world-fames patent medicines , so I took of Eno 's Fruit Salt 190 bottles , Warner 's Safe Cure , 200 bottles ; Townsend 's Sarsaparilla , 120 bottles ; Hop Bitters , 180 bottles ; Dandelion Ale , two hogsheads . I took Hayter 's Nerve Tonic , Hayter 's Blood purifier , Hayter 's Invigorator , and Hayter 's Pick-Me-Up , of each 100 bottles ; and Wolfe 's Schnapps , 630 bottles — but I felt no better . Another friend came along , and said for my complaint it was no use taking medicines internally , and I must use the “ Rub On Remedies , ” so I rubbed on Holloway 's Ointment , 241 boxes ; Davis 's Pain Killer , 70 bottles ; Moulton 's Pain Paint , 60 bottles ; St. Jacob 's oil , Weston 's Wizard Oil , and Croton Oil , of each 100 bottles : and of Eucalyptus Oil , 900 quart bottles — but I felt no better . Another friend advised the Herb Cure , so I took strong decoctions of Chamomile , Pennyroyal , Peppermint , Rue , Tansy , Quassia , Horehound , Wormwood , Aconite , Belladonna , Hemlock , Nux Vomica , Lungwort , Liverwort , Moonwort , Sneezewort , and Snakeweed — altogether I took about 1700 quarts of these horrid decoctions — but I felt no better . Another friend told me my stomach was out of order , and required cleansing , so I took of Ipecacuanha Wine 139 quarts — but this did not cure me . Another friend said all diseases come from insects , and I had insects in me , and must take special medicine for them , so I took of Keating 's insecticide 730 packets — but got no better . Another friend advised me to try Homoeopathy . I took 111 tubes of pilules and 80 bottles of tinctures — but they did me no good . Another friend advised me to try the water cure . I took cold baths , warm baths , tepid baths , and Turkish baths in hundreds , and drank about twenty hogsheads of mineral waters — but it did me no good . Another friend advised the Acid Cure , so I took Acetic Acid , Muriatic Acid , Nitric Acid , Sulphuric Acid , Oxalic Acid , and Prussic Acid , of each about twenty quarts — but got no better . Another friend advised Soothing Medicines , so I took over 400 of Steedman 's Soothing powders , and 130 bottles of Mother Winslow 's Soothing Syrup — but I was still irritable and nervous . My last course of medicine consisted of Steel Drops , Balm of Gilead , Turpentine , Chloroform , Cod Liver Oil , Assafoetida , Spanish Flies , and Cayenne Pepper — about fifteen pounds of each — but it all did me no good . I simply got worse and worse , and was reduced to a mere shadow of skin and bone , but , as luck would have it , another friend came along — a true friend this time — and suggested Cole 's FUN DOCTOR . I got it , and was well and stout in a Week , at a cost of 1s 6d .</p>

   <p>The Sea-Serpent as a Carrier</p>
   <p>The world-renowned sea-serpent has been specially chartered to bring a fresh supply of books every week from England to Cole 's Book Arcade , Melbourne ; and also to show upon the coils of his body 2000 rainbows , being so many copies of that establishment . The sea-serpent , upon being communicated with , demanded a heavy price for his services , but Mr. Cole agreed to his terms , as he considered that 2000 of his rainbow signs travelling round the world on the sides of the famous sea-serpent would be a good advertisement for the Book Arcade .</p>

   <p>True History of the Great Sea Serpent</p>
   <p>John Smith , the sea-serpent , was born in a swamp near Sydney , about 5000 years ago . He was hatched by a female Bunyip from an immense three cornered egg , which is supposed to have fallen out of the moon , and he is the only sea-serpent that ever existed . He never had relations , and is the only being in the world of whom the verse is true . He never had a father . He never had a mother . He never had a sister . He never had a brother . He also never had a wife . He is of a very shy disposition , and many fascinating mermaids have made love to him , and practiced all their well-known wiles upon him — but in vain : he is a bachelor still . Like some other animals mentioned in history , he thinks and talks like a man . He is exceedingly intelligent , and seems to have as much sense as 20 , 000 ordinary men or 21 , 000 women . He can sing with a voice of tremendous compass , from the sweet piping of a nightingale down to far below the deepest tones of the largest organ , or the noise made by discharges of artillery . Sometimes when he sings it shakes the ground for miles around , and if at sea causes a storm . His favourite songs are “ A Life on the Ocean Wave , ” “ What are the Wild Waves Saying , ” “ Down by the Deep Sad Sea , ” and such like . He plays all the musical instruments in the world . His whistle can be heard a distance of 100 miles , his shout 50 miles , and his whisper 10 miles . Of course , in an active life of 5000 years , a life almost as long as some Hindoo patriarchs , he has seen and heard , and done , many astonishing things . He relates that he once rescued a travelling menagerie at sea , he swallowed the whole lot of animals , and the woman in charge of them , let them roam about inside of him and enjoy themselves , and then landed them safely on dry land at the end of 48 hours . He says that he was in Arabia , and saw that remarkable occurrence of the moon coming down and going into Mahomet 's sleeves , and there and then he objected to the whole proceeding . The sea-serpent is 15 miles long and 50 feet in diameter , his skin is of a horny nature , but harder than steel , and about 5 feet thick . He travels at the rate of 200 miles per hour , and can carry 120 times as much as the “ Great Eastern . ” If he was coming up to the Queen 's Wharf , Melbourne , when his head was at the wharf , his body would reach right down the River Yarra out in the Bay past Williamstown , and the Traffic would have to be stopped in the river whilst he was unloading . The sea-serpent is rather a large eater . Since he reached full growth , namely , for the last 4000 years , he has swallowed a whole whale every morning for breakfast except once . The reason of his going without his breakfast that once is explained in the following manner :—</p>
   <p>The reader will remember the account of Jonah and the Whale in the Talmud . It states that when Jonah was in the whale 's belly , it went out of the Mediterranean right around Africa into the Red Sea , and that Jonah looked out through the eyes of the whale and saw the place where the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea . The sea-serpent states that he can corroborate this piece of history , as he happened to be after that very whale for breakfast when he saw Jonah looking out through its eyes . He says he did not swallow that whale , as he had found that the whales which he had previously swallowed with prophets inside of them did not agree with him , and consequently he had to go that morning without his breakfast , the first time in 4000 years . Those who want any further information about the famous sea-serpent can acquire it at Cole 's Book Arcade , Melbourne , or come and interview and question the sea-serpent himself when he arrives .</p>
   <p>P. S .— Some people do n't believe in the existence of the sea-serpent , but if he did not exist how could we have got his likeness and his history ? That 's a question for the unbelievers to answer .</p>

   <p>“ In the United States Weather Bureau .— ‘ Chief of United States Weather Bureau , Willis M. Moore , has placed the ban on cigarettes in this department of Government service ’ . ”</p>
   <p>Smoking Does Some Good , but More Evil</p>
   <p>Smoking soothes and comforts millions of the worried and the weary , and brings much pleasure to the habitual smoker , but it always more or less injures the health of the smoker and sometimes kills him . The vast majority of the medical fraternity condemn smoking , especially by the young .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Smoking injures multitudes of boys in many respects .</l>
     <l n="2">Smoking often leads to boys into bad company .</l>
     <l n="3">Smoking often makes them precocious , undutiful , impudent and</l>
     <l n="4">callous .</l>
     <l n="5">Smoking often ruins the health .</l>
     <l n="6">Smoking generally stunts their growth .</l>
     <l n="7">Smoking generally sallows their complexion .</l>

     <l n="9">Smoking often leads them to stealing .</l>
     <l n="10">Smoking often leads them to drinking .</l>
     <l n="11">Smoking degenerates the boy physically , mentally , and morally .</l>
     <l n="12">Smokers cannot excel in athletic sports , such as boating , cricket ,</l>
     <l n="13">cycling .</l>
     <l n="14">Smokers are always at the bottom of the class in school and</l>
     <l n="15">college , and backward at all kinds of study .</l>
     <l n="16">Excessive smoking causes mental and physical laziness in boys and</l>
     <l n="17">men .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following organs , fluids , functions , etc ., of the body , especially of the young , are frequently more or less affected by the use of tobacco :— The blood , the heart , the nerves , the brain , the liver , the lungs , the stomach , the throat , the saliva , the taste , the voice , the eyes , the ears , the nose , the mouth , the tongue , the palate , the pancreas , the lips , the teeth , the bones , the skin .</p>
   <p>Medical men and observing experts affirm many diseases are caused or accelerated by the use of tobacco , among which are the following :— Heart disease , consumption , cancer , ulceration , asthma , bronchitis , neuralgia , paralysis , palsy , apoplexy , indigestion , dysentery , diarrhoea , constipation , sleeplessness , melancholia , delirium tremens , insanity .</p>
   <p>Smoking frequently leads to prolonged suffering . Smoking often destroys the appetite . Smoking sometimes weakens the will power . Smoking sometimes leads to loss of memory . Smoking often leads to despondency . Smoking sometimes leads to suicide . Smoking frequently leads to loss — loss by bad health and waste of valuable time — direct loss in money required for other purposes , and immense loss through reckless , thoughtless , or unfortunate smokers being the cause of partial or total destruction by fire of buildings , ships , factories , homesteads , crops , stores , and property of many kinds ; also loss of life and property by explosions in mines , explosive factories , powder magazines , explosive stores , etc .</p>
   <p>Tobacco using is an unclean habit , and offensive habit , an enslaving habit , often it is an intensely selfish habit . Tobacco fumes , especially in small and poorly-ventilated houses or rooms , injure or destroy the health of multitudes of wives , and injure the health of multitudes of infants and children . Tobacco using injures the unborn child by giving it a puny body and an imperfect start in life . Tobacco using is fast degenerating the race .</p>
   <p>A third of the recruits for the Army are disqualified through smoking .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The following Governments have passes laws against juvenile smoking :</l>
     <l n="2">Germany , Switzerland , Norway , Japan , Canada , Nova Scotia , New</l>

     <l n="4">Territories , Cape Colony , New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia ,</l>
     <l n="5">Tasmania , and about 48 of the States and Territories out of 53 ; and</l>
     <l n="6">so terrible and deplorable an effect has juvenile smoking upon the</l>
     <l n="7">race that most other Governments are considering the advisability of</l>
     <l n="8">passing laws against it .</l>

   <p>Narcotics and Intoxicants</p>
   <p>In most parts of the word man has found out some way of stimulating , soothing , or deadening his animal system by means of plants or drugs . Hundreds of these stimulating , intoxicating , soothing , and stupefying substances have been discovered and used in various countries , chief amongst which may be mentioned —</p>
   <p>Opium , Tobacco , Indian Hemp , Betel Nut , and Alcohol ; and others are used in a less degree , such as Coca , Kola Nut , Thorn Apple , Cocculus Indicus , Intoxicating Toadstool , Deadly Nightshade , Henbane , Rhododendron , Azalea , Emetic Holly , Bearded Darnel , etc . The first five among those human pleasers and human destroyers are —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">1 . Alcohol , now drank in the shape of spirits , wine , beer , or some</l>
     <l n="2">other form probably by 500 , 000 , 000 persons .</l>
     <l n="3">2 . Opium , smoked , inhaled , drank or swallowed by probably</l>
     <l n="4">100 , 000 , 000 .</l>
     <l n="5">3 . Tobacco , now smoked , chewed , and snuffed by probably 300 , 000 , 000</l>
     <l n="6">4 . Haschish , made from Indian Hemp , now smoked , chewed , or</l>
     <l n="7">swallowed by probably 150 , 000 , 000 .</l>
     <l n="8">5 . Betel Nut , chewed probably by 50 , 000 , 000 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These five narcotising and intoxicating poisons are used , more or less , by half the people in the world , giving some considerable pleasure at times , but destroying , more or less , the health of all who use them , and gradually stunting the form and otherwise undermining the well-being of the entire human race .</p>
   <p>Chemistry also produces many things which are taken in the same way and for the same purpose , such as Laudanum , Morphia , Cocaine , Chloral , Chloroform , Ether , &amp; c ., and many so-called patent medicines . These all tend to form habits which soothe and please for a time , but they all damage or destroy in the end .</p>
   <p>The great bulk of easy-going , unreflecting people have no idea what an amount of mischief and misery the habit of using these things inflict upon poor humanity .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Books show narcotics , toxicants ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of each and every kind ;</l>
     <l n="3">Insidious destroyers all ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of body and of mind .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These four pages show at a glance the effects of the three most fascinating and seductive Drugs in the world — Tobacco , Opium , and Alcohol , and which physically , mentally , and morally injure or ruin the greatest number of mankind .</p>

   <p>The Drink Craving</p>
   <p>Probably the best use a man can make of his leisure time is to read good books and to follow their advice , and the worst use he can make of it is to indulge in intoxicating liquor , and to go where that will lead or take him .</p>
   <p>It is said that “ Dipsomania , ” “ Alcoholism , ” or the “ Craving-for-Drink ” disease can be cured in most persons by certain remedies an proper management , and the time has come now when the lovers of human progress everywhere feel that this fearful curse must be grappled with , and , if possible , stamped out like the smallpox , or any other terrible disease . One writer sums up the evils of drinking as follows :—</p>

   <p>GOD</p>
   <p>Go to the top of a mountain so that you can see 50 miles in all directions ; you then observe a space 100 miles in diameter . Now the world contains 25 , 000 such areas as that . Our world is amazingly vast , but our sun is a million times as large ; yet we see rolling in space thousands as large as our own , which probably have accompanying worlds . And again , beyond this the telescope and astral-photography reveal to us that to the right , and to the left , before and behind , above and below , and to every point of the heavens , and at immense distances , millions and millions again of enormous stellar bodies exist , roll , revolve and travel through space . Multitudes of these suns and worlds around us in every direction are at such immense distances that a person travelling with the speed of light , namely , 200 , 000 miles , or 8 times round our earth , in a second , world take 1000 , 000 years to reach them . Nor can we imagine an end to this stupendous universe , or an end to space , for is we try to do so the question immediately occurs , what is still outside and beyond that ? And so on to incomprehensible and overwhelming infinitude . And these many millions of suns and worlds and systems and all their parts are clearly working together , like the most exquisitely designed clockwork . Look at the marvellous mechanism of the human brain , the human eye , the human hand , the human heart , and in fact the whole human structure and composition ; they all prove the truth of the affirmation that man is “ fearfully and wonderfully made . ” Nay further , examine carefully every object in existence , however stupendously large or , as shown by the microscope , infinitesimally small , and they each and all appear equally perfect for their purpose . Can we see all this , and think on it , and not imagine a Designer and Controller of infinite attributes ? It always appeared to me that there must be in this vast , illimitable , and beautiful universe , myriads of beings , superior to our weak mortal selves , and at the head of all and over all , an immortal Being of infinite perfections , which thinking men in all countries and ages have called GOD . And shall not we , immortal souls , increase in knowledge and wisdom , and as the ages roll on , more and more perceive and understand this mighty universe and its Author ? I firmly believe we shall , and that as yet we are only beginning to live and think and understand and appreciate .</p>
   <p>The Supreme Being was believed in , praised and worshipped by all the ancient peoples , and is now believed in , praised and worshipped by the vast majority of the people of the world — it is true under different names , but still it is the same idea — a Being without beginning and without end — Infinite in Wisdom — Infinite in Goodness — Infinite in Power — Infinite in Action and , at all times , everywhere and present .</p>

   <p>The Ancients ’ Idea of God</p>
   <p>God extends from eternity to eternity .— Aristotle .</p>
   <p>Nothing is more ancient than God , for He was never created ; nothing more beautiful than the world , it is the work of that same God .— Thales .</p>
   <p>Nature herself has imprinted on the minds of all the idea of a God ; for what nation or race of men is there that has not , even without being taught , some idea of a God .— Cicero .</p>

     <l n="1">There is one God ; Him the Christians , Him the Jews , Him all the</l>
     <l n="2">Gentile people worship .— Emperor Adrian .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Amid so much war , contest , and variety of opinion , you will find one consenting conviction in every land that there is one God , the King and Father of all .— Maximus Tyrius .</p>
   <p>If we suppose a God , to Him there can be nothing mean and nothing great . The most trivial things must be equal under His regard as the most august . All-powerful , omniscient , and omnipresent , He must encompass all things , and pervade all things . Ignorant of nothing , forgetting nothing , despising nothing , He must direct the operations of the universe with perfect skill , and sustain every part in consummate order .— Plato .</p>
   <p>What land or what see will man find without God ? Into what part of the earth wilt thou descend and hide thyself , O unhappy wretch ! where thou canst escape from God ?— Plutarch .</p>
   <p>Thine , O Lord , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty ; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth , is Thine ; Thine is the kingdom , O Lord , and Thou art exalted as head above all .— David .</p>

   <p>What an immense workman is God ! in miniature as well as in the great . With the one hand , perhaps , He is making a ring of one hundred thousand miles in diameter , to revolve round a planet like Saturn , and with the other as forming a tooth in the ray of a feather of a humming-bird , or a point in the claw of the foot of a microscopic insect . When he works in miniature , everything is gilded , polished , and perfect , but whatever is made by human art , as a needle , etc ., when viewed by a microscope , appears rough , and coarse , and bungling .— Bishop Law .</p>
