   <head>THE PARTS .</head>
   <head>THE ATTRACTIVE OR MELODRAMATIC PERIOD .</head>
   <p>Love took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with might , Smote the chord of Self , that , trembling , passed in music out of sight .</p>
   <p>TENNYSON .</p>
   <p>The power to detach , and to magnify by detaching , is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and the poet . This rhetoric , or power to fix the momentary eminence of an object , so remarkable in Burke , in Byron , in Carlyle — depends upon the depth of the artist 's insight of that object he contemplates .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER I .</p>
   <p>SLIDE .</p>
   <p>Thus far in the student 's development , his mind has dealt chiefly with each subject as a Whole . Now he begins to find a new interest in showing his hearers that the discourse is made up of a series of definite Parts . He takes delight in fixing their attention upon each part in succession .</p>
   <p>As in crossing a brook on stones , a person poises for a moment , first on one stone , then on another , so the speaker balances the minds of his hearers , first on one thought , then another , poising for a moment on each distinct point before leaving it for the next . The teacher should now lead the pupil to attract attention to separate parts as wholes . We are entering the melodramatic stage , where abandon to each part is as necessary as it was in the beginning to the spirit of the whole . The pupil must see the parts and give them to others at any cost .</p>
   <p>In the history of art this step is marked by the grotesque ; the pupil should be encouraged to stand out the points of thought boldly , regardless of artistic effect . This step is of vital importance in all future development , and unless emphasized now , will require constant effort hereafter .</p>
   <p>Sharp contrasts are brought strongly to bear in presenting vividly and distinctly separate points of thought . As the pupil earnestly strives to impress each point of thought , in all its new interest , his voice becomes more decidedly modulated , rising and falling in distinct intervals . Thought of each part as a whole and by contrast , together with the desire to impart it , is reported in varied inflections which add a new charm to expression . Through slides the voice of the speaker may be said to express the tune of the thought .</p>
   <p>Analysis . Example : “ Tact and Talent . ” ( Page 13 . )</p>
   <p>Unit , or Whole : A comparison of Tact and Talent .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Parts :</l>
     <l n="2">( a ) The characteristics of Tact .</l>
     <l n="3">Sub-parts :</l>
     <l n="4">1 . Tact is infinitely resourceful . Paragraph 1 , etc .</l>
     <l n="5">2 . Tact is the power which achieves results . Paragraph 2 , etc .</l>
     <l n="6">( Other “ sub-parts ” may be enumerated . )</l>
     <l n="7">( b ) The characteristics of Talent .</l>
     <l n="8">( A number of “ sub-parts ” are embodied . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The teacher should view the work of the pupil with special reference to the parts of this selection , leading him to impress these parts , or successive points of thought , upon his audience . The continued antithesis makes this selection a good one for the purpose ; parts that are set in contrast easily engage the attention .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER II .</head>
    <head>VITAL SLIDE .</head>
    <head>As the mind of the pupil separates each thought from the other main thoughts of the discourse , and holds it before the minds of his hearers , he finds it more and more attractive . His endeavor to interest others deepens his own interest , and the slides in his voice report this increased concentration , in increased vitality . The pupil seeing the spirit and life of the whole in each vital part , or part vital to the life of the unit , desires to make each part live as a whole in the minds of the listeners . He no longer touches it with uncertain stroke ; the slide has become a Vital Slide .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Analysis . Example : “ The Rising of 1776 . ” ( Page 35 . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Unit , or Whole : A pastor of early Revolutionary times who makes his</l>
     <l n="3">Sunday sermon an appeal for freedom .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Parts : ( a ) The spirit of the times . Stanza 1 . ( b ) The church and the people . Stanzas 2 and 3 . ( c ) The pastor and his appeal . Stanzas 4 , 5 , 6 and part of 9 . ( d ) The effect of the appeal . Stanzas 7 , 8 and 9 .</p>
   <p>Let the student 's earnest endeavor be to interest his audience in these essential parts . The words which especially reveal these vital parts of the selection will be given with no uncertain stroke . If the interest of both speaker and listener is fully aroused , the slide has become a vital one . Remember always that the desired effect in the voice results from the mental concept ; it is not developed mechanically , but grows out of thought .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER III .</p>
   <p>SLIDE IN VOLUME .</p>
   <p>As the mind of the student continues to dwell upon the parts of the subject as separate and distinct wholes , there is gradually developed within him an appreciation of the value of each part . Out of the effort to make each thought live in the minds of the hearers is born the desire to reveal the value of that thought . This desire is reported in the voice through Slide in Volume .</p>
   <p>The significance of the term Volume has been explained in an earlier chapter . The valuable parts that the speaker presents are expressed through inflections that suggest breadth and freedom . Each part is felt to have a value of its own , intellectual , moral , esthetic , or spiritual .</p>
   <p>Freedom of will is expressed in the voice by slide in volume , for the speaker , convinced of the truth of his thought , is learning obedience to it , and obedience is always the way to freedom .</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that the intellect determines the value of the parts . It is true that the discernment is sharpened by the sensibility ; but the feelings , unguided by the thought , may be misleading . Feeling is dangerous unless controlled by thought . All sentiment must be directed to the audience “ thought foremost ” — the thought itself must induce the feeling .</p>
   <p>Analysis . Example : “ The Bells . ” ( Page 82 . )</p>
   <p>Unit of thought : Varied bells , expressing varied emotion .</p>
   <p>Parts : ( a ) The tinkling bells of Merriment . Stanza 1 . ( b ) The mellow bells of Love . Stanza 2 . ( c ) The clanging bells of Terror . Stanza 3 . ( d ) The tolling bells of Menace . Stanza 4 .</p>
   <p>This poem is well adapted to develop power in emphasizing parts : the several parts are very distinctly differentiated , as the student must reveal through the rendering . He should strive to reveal them as graphically as the author has set them forth . Moreover , he should endeavor to make their value felt . In doing this , he will perceive the varying scale of values ; some of the bells reflect great value , others less .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER IV .</p>
   <p>FORMING PICTURES .</p>
   <p>The student 's persistent endeavor to impress the successive parts of his theme upon the minds in his presence will eventually lead him to see those parts in picturesque groupings . As he flashes these pictures upon the mental vision of the audience , they become clearer to his own vision . His own power of imagery is in proportion to his ability to impart this power to others . Herein lies one of the most helpful means of cultivating the imagination ,— the eye of the intellect ,— the basis of all sympathy . Every effort to tell a story clearly so as to impress its details upon the minds of others , every attempt to picture a landscape , a meadow , a river , a sunset vividly to others , quickens and strengthens the pupil 's own imaging power . His attempt to make his listeners put themselves in the place of another , see through the eyes and from the point of view of a Wordsworth or Shakespeare , quickens his own imagination , broadens his sympathies , and develops his intellect as nothing else can . “ The man of imagination has lived all lives , has enjoyed all heavens , and felt the pang of every hell . ”</p>
   <p>The student must continue to watch for the effect of his words in other minds . He cannot afford to be introspective while speaking , for the mind cannot be in the creative and in the critical state at the same time . The pictures , then , must be formed in the minds of the hearers ; they are the only canvas upon which he can hope to paint his picturesque parts . They are the mirror in which the pictures of his thought must be reflected , as the stars are mirrored in the waters of the lake .</p>
   <p>Analysis . Example : “ The Chambered Nautilus . ” ( Page 111 . )</p>
   <p>Unit , or Whole : The lesson of the Chambered Nautilus .</p>
   <p>Parts : ( a ) The Nautilus . Stanzas 1 , 2 . ( b ) Its method of growth . Stanza 3 . ( c ) Its message to the soul . Stanzas 4 , 5 .</p>
   <p>Lead the pupil to present a clear picture of “ the ship of pearl , ” of its own original environment and course of evolution , and of the beautiful figure which embodies the lesson .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER I .</p>
   <p>SLIDE .</p>
   <p>TACT AND TALENT .</p>
   <p>1 . Talent is something , but tact is everything . Talent is serious , sober , grave , and respectable ; tact is all that , and more too . It is not a sixth sense , but it is the life of all the five . It is the open eye , the quick ear , the judging taste , the keen smell , and the lively touch ; it is the interpreter of all riddles , the surmounter of all difficulties , the remover of all obstacles . It is useful in all places , and at all times ; it is useful in solitude , for it shows a man his way into the world ; it is useful in society , for it shows him his way through the world .</p>
   <p>2 . Talent is power , tact is skill ; talent is weight , tact is momentum ; talent knows what to do , tact knows how to do it ; talent makes a man respectable , tact will make him respected ; talent is wealth , tact is ready money .</p>
   <p>3 . For all the practical purposes of life , tact carries it against talent , ten to one . Take them to the theatre , and put them against each other on the stage , and talent shall produce you a tragedy that will scarcely live long enough to be condemned , while tact keeps the house in a roar , night after night , with its successful farces . There is no want of dramatic talent , there is no want of dramatic tact ; but they are seldom together : so we have successful pieces which are not respectable , and respectable pieces which are not successful .</p>
   <p>4 . Take them to the bar , and let them shake their learned curls at each other in legal rivalry . Talent sees its way clearly , but tact is first at its journey 's end . Talent has many a compliment from the bench , but tact touches fees from attorneys and clients . Talent speaks learnedly and logically , tact triumphantly . Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster , tact excites astonishment that it gets on so fast . And the secret is , that tact has no weight to carry ; it makes no false steps ; it hits the right nail on the head ; it loses no time ; it takes all hints ; and , by keeping its eye on the weathercock , is ready to take advantage of every wind that blows .</p>
   <p>5 . Take them into the church . Talent has always something worth hearing , tact is sure of abundance of hearers ; talent may obtain a good living , tact will make one ; talent gets a good name , tact a great one ; talent convinces , tact converts ; talent is an honor to the profession , tact gains honor from the profession .</p>
   <p>6 . Place them in the senate . Talent has the ear of the house , but tact wins its heart , and has its votes ; talent is fit for employment , but tact is fitted for it . Tact has a knack of slipping into place with a sweet silence and glibness of movement , as a billiard ball insinuates itself into the pocket . It seems to know everything , without learning anything . It has served an invisible and extemporary apprenticeship ; it wants no drilling ; it never ranks in the awkward squad ; it has no left hand , no deaf ear , no blind side . It puts on no looks of wondrous wisdom , it has no air of profundity , but plays with the details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand flourishes over the keys of the pianoforte . It has all the air of commonplace , and all the force and power of genius .</p>

    <head>SHYLOCK TO ANTONIO .</head>
     <l n="1">Signor Antonio , many a time and oft</l>
     <l n="2">In the Rialto you have rated me</l>
     <l n="3">About my moneys and my usances :</l>
     <l n="4">Still I have borne it with a patient shrug ;</l>
     <l n="5">For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe .</l>
     <l n="6">You call me misbeliever , cut-throat dog ,</l>
     <l n="7">And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all for use of that which is mine own .</l>
     <l n="9">Well , then , it now appears , you need my help :</l>
     <l n="10">Go to , then ; you come to me , and you say</l>
     <l n="11">“ Shylock , we would have moneys . ” You say so ;</l>
     <l n="12">You that did void your rheum upon my beard ,</l>
     <l n="13">And foot me , as you spurn a stranger cur</l>
     <l n="14">Over your threshold ; moneys is your suit .</l>
     <l n="15">What should I say to you ? Should I not say —</l>
     <l n="16">“ Hath a dog money ? Is it possible</l>
     <l n="17">A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? ” or</l>
     <l n="18">Shall I bend low , and in a bondman 's key ,</l>
     <l n="19">With bated breath and whispering humbleness ,</l>
     <l n="20">Say this —</l>
     <l n="21">“ Fair sir , you spit on me on Wednesday last ;</l>
     <l n="22">You spurned me such a day ; another time</l>
     <l n="23">You called me dog ; and for these courtesies</l>
     <l n="24">I 'll lend you thus much moneys ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SHAKESPEARE .</p>
   <p>THE CYNIC .</p>
   <p>1 . The Cynic is one who never sees a good quality in a man , and never fails to see a bad one . He is the human owl , vigilant in darkness and blind to light , mousing for vermin , and never seeing noble game .</p>
   <p>2 . The Cynic puts all human actions into only two classes — openly bad and secretly bad . All virtue , and generosity , and disinterestedness , are merely the appearance of good , but selfish at the bottom . He holds that no man does a good thing except for profit . The effect of his conversation upon your feelings is to chill and sear them , to send you away sour and morose .</p>
   <p>3 . His criticisms and innuendoes fall indiscriminately upon every lovely thing like frost upon the flowers . If Mr. A. is pronounced a religious man , he will reply : yes , on Sundays . Mr. B. has just joined the church : certainly , the elections are coming on . The minister of the gospel is called an example of diligence : it is his trade . Such a man is generous : of other men 's money . This man is obliging : to lull suspicion and cheat you . That man is upright , because he is green .</p>
   <p>4 . Thus his eye strains out every good quality , and takes in only the bad . To him religion is hypocrisy , honesty a preparation for fraud , virtue only a want of opportunity , and undeniable purity , asceticism . The livelong day he will coolly sit with sneering lip , transfixing every character that is presented .</p>
   <p>5 . It is impossible to indulge in such habitual severity of opinion upon our fellow-men , without injuring the tenderness and delicacy of our own feelings . A man will be what his most cherished feelings are . If he encourage a noble generosity , every feeling will be enriched by it ; if he nurse bitter and envenomed thoughts , his own spirit will absorb the poison , and he will crawl among men as a burnished adder , whose life is mischief , and whose errand is death .</p>
   <p>6 . He who hunts for flowers will find flowers ; and he who loves weeds will find weeds .</p>
   <p>Let it be remembered that no man , who is not himself morally diseased , will have a relish for disease in others . Reject , then , the morbid ambition of the Cynic , or cease to call yourself a man .</p>

   <p>LORD BYRON .</p>
   <p>UNWRITTEN MUSIC .</p>
   <p>1 . There is unwritten music . The world is full of it . I hear it every hour that I wake ; and my waking sense is surpassed sometimes by my sleeping , though that is a mystery . There is no sound of simple nature that is not music . It is all God 's work , and so harmony . You may mingle , and divide , and strengthen the passages of its great anthem ; and it is still melody ,— melody .</p>
   <p>2 . The low winds of summer blow over the waterfalls and the brooks , and bring their voices to your ear , as if their sweetness were linked by an accurate finger ; yet the wind is but a fitful player ; and you may go out when the tempest is up and hear the strong trees moaning as they lean before it , and the long grass hissing as it sweeps through , and its own solemn monotony over all ; and the dripple of that same brook , and the waterfall 's unaltered bass shall still reach you , in the intervals of its power , as much in harmony as before , and as much a part of its perfect and perpetual hymn .</p>
   <p>3 . There is no accident of nature 's causing which can bring in discord . The loosened rock may fall into the abyss , and the overblown tree rush down through the branches of the wood , and the thunder peal awfully in the sky ; and sudden and violent as their changes seem , their tumult goes up with the sound of wind and waters , and the exquisite ear of the musician can detect no jar .</p>
   <p>4 . I have read somewhere of a custom in the Highlands , which , in connection with the principle it involves , is exceedingly beautiful . It is believed that , to the ear of the dying ( which just before death becomes always exquisitely acute ,) the perfect harmony of the voices of nature is so ravishing , as to make him forget his suffering , and die gently , as in a pleasant trance . And so , when the last moment approaches , they take him from the close shieling , and bear him out into the open sky , that he may hear the familiar rushing of the streams . I can believe that is not superstition . I do not think we know how exquisitely nature 's many voices are attuned to harmony and to each other .</p>
   <p>5 . The old philosopher we read of might not have been dreaming when he discovered that the order of the sky was like a scroll of written music , and that two stars ( which are said to have appeared centuries after his death , in the very places he mentioned ) were wanting to complete the harmony . We know how wonderful are the phenomena of color , how strangely like consummate art the strongest dyes are blended in the plumage of birds , and in the cups of flowers ; so that , to the practiced eye of the painter , the harmony is inimitably perfect .</p>
   <p>6 . It is natural to suppose every part of the universe equally perfect ; and it is a glorious and elevating thought , that the stars of Heaven are moving on continually to music , and that the sounds we daily listen to are but part of a melody that reaches to the very centre of God 's illimitable spheres .</p>

   <p>FREDERIC LAWRENCE KNOWLES .</p>
   <p>TAXATION OF THE COLONIES .</p>
   <p>1 . Sir : I agree with the honorable gentleman who spoke last , that this subject is not new to this House . Very disagreeably to this House , very unfortunately to this nation , and to the peace and prosperity of this whole empire , no topic has been more familiar to us . For nine long years , session after session , we have been lashed round and round this miserable circle of occasional arguments and temporary expedients .</p>
   <p>2 . I am sure our heads must turn and our stomachs nauseate with them . We have had them in every shape . We have looked at them in every point of view . Invention is exhausted ; reason is fatigued ; experience has given judgment ; but obstinacy is not yet conquered .</p>
   <p>3 . The act of 1767 , which grants this tea-duty , sets forth in its preamble , that it was expedient to raise a revenue in America for the support of the civil government there , as well as for purposes still more extensive . About two years after this act was passed , the ministry thought it expedient to repeal five of the duties , and to leave ( for reasons best known to themselves ) only the sixth standing .</p>
   <p>4 . But I hear it rung continually in my ears , now and formerly ,— “ The preamble ! what will become of the preamble if you repeal this tax ? ” The clerk will be so good as to turn to this act , and to read this favorite preamble .</p>
   <p>5 . “ Whereas it is expedient that a revenue should be raised in your Majesty 's dominions in America , for making a more certain and adequate provision for defraying the charge of the administration of justice and support of civil government in such provinces where it shall be found necessary , and towards further defraying the expenses of defending , protecting , and securing the said dominions . ”</p>
   <p>6 . You have heard this pompous performance . Now , where is the revenue which is to do all these mighty things ? Five-sixths repealed ,— abandoned ,— sunk ,— gone ,— lost forever . Does the poor solitary tea-duty support the purposes of this preamble ? Is not the supply there stated as effectually abandoned as if the tea-duty had perished in the general wreck ? Here , Mr. Speaker , is a precious mockery :— a preamble without an act ,— taxes granted in order to be repealed ,— and the reason of the grant carefully kept up ! This is raising a revenue in America ! This is preserving dignity in England !</p>
   <p>7 . Never did a people suffer so much for the empty words of a preamble . It must be given up . For on what principle does it stand ? This famous revenue stands , at this hour , on all the debate , as a description of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehensive ( but too comprehensive ! ) vocabulary of finance — a preambulary tax . It is , indeed , a tax of sophistry , a tax of pedantry , a tax of disputation , a tax of war and rebellion , a tax for anything but benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject .</p>
   <p>8 . Well ! but whatever it is , gentlemen will force the colonists to take the teas . You will force them ? Has seven years ’ struggle been yet able to force them ? Oh , but it seems “ we are in the right . The tax is trifling ,— in effect rather an exoneration than an imposition ; three-fourths of the duty formerly payable on teas exported to America is taken off ,— the place of collection is only shifted ; instead of the retention of a shilling from the drawback here , it is three-pence custom paid in America . ”</p>
   <p>9 . All this , sir , is very true . But this is the very folly and mischief of the act . Incredible as it may seem , you know that you have deliberately thrown away a large duty , which you held secure and quiet in your hands , for the vain hope of getting one three-fourths less , through every hazard , through certain litigation , and possibly through war .</p>
   <p>10 . Could anything be a subject of more just alarm to America , than to see you go out of the plain high-road of finance , and give up your most certain revenues and your clearest interest , merely for the sake of insulting the colonies ? No man ever doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an imposition of three pence . But no commodity will bear three pence , or will bear a penny , when the general feelings of men are irritated , and two millions of people are resolved not to pay .</p>
   <p>11 . The feelings of the colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain . Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr. Hampden , when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings . Would twenty shillings have ruined Mr. Hampden 's fortune ? No ! but the payment of half twenty shillings , on the principle it was demanded , would have made him a slave . It is the weight of that preamble , of which you are so fond , and not the weight of the duty , that the Americans are unable and unwilling to bear .</p>
   <p>12 . It is , then , sir , upon the principle of this measure , and nothing else , that we are at issue . It is a principle of political expediency . Your act of 1767 asserts that it is expedient to raise a revenue in America ; your act of 1769 , which takes away that revenue , contradicts the act of 1767 , and by something much stronger than words , asserts that it is not expedient . It is a reflection upon your wisdom to persist in a solemn parliamentary declaration of the expediency of any object , for which , at the same time , you make no provision .</p>
   <p>13 . And pray , sir , let not this circumstance escape you ,— it is very material ,— that the preamble of this act which we wish to repeal , is not declaratory of a right , as some gentlemen seem to argue it : it is only a recital of the expediency of a certain exercise of right supposed already to have been asserted ; an exercise you are now contending for by ways and means which you confess , though they were obeyed , to be utterly insufficient for their purpose . You are , therefore , at this moment in the awkward situation of fighting for a phantom ,— a quiddity ,— a thing that wants not only a substance , but even a name ,— for a thing which is neither abstract right nor profitable enjoyment .</p>
   <p>14 . They tell you , sir , that your dignity is tied to it . I know not how it happens , but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance to you ; for it has of late been ever at war with your interest , your equity , and every idea of your policy . Show the thing you contend for to be reason , show it to be common sense , show it to be the means of attaining some useful end , and then I am content to allow it what dignity you please . But what dignity is derived from the perseverance in absurdity is more than ever I could discern .</p>
   <p>15 . The honorable gentleman has said well , that this subject does not stand as it did formerly . Oh , certainly not ! Every hour you continue on this ill-chosen ground , your difficulties thicken around you ; and therefore my conclusion is , remove from a bad position as quickly as you can . The disgrace , and the necessity of yielding , both of them , grow upon you every hour of your delay .</p>

     <l n="1">Ros . [ Aside to Celia . ] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey and</l>
     <l n="2">under that habit play the knave with him . Do you hear , forester ?</l>

     <l n="4">Ros . I pray you , what is't o'clock ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">Orl . You should ask me what time o ’ day : there 's no clock in the</l>
     <l n="6">forest .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Ros . Then there is no true lover in the forest ; else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock .</p>
   <p>Orl . And why not the swift foot of Time ? had not that been as proper ?</p>
   <p>Ros . By no means , sir : Time travels in divers paces with divers persons . I 'll tell you who Time ambles withal , who Time trots withal , who Time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .</p>
   <p>Orl . I prithee , who doth he trot withal ?</p>
   <p>Ros . Marry , he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz 'd ; if the interim be but a se'nnight , Time 's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven years .</p>
   <p>Orl . Who ambles Time withal ?</p>
   <p>Ros . With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout , for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study , and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain , the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning , the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury ; these Time ambles withal .</p>
   <p>Orl . Who doth he galop withal ?</p>
   <p>Ros . With a thief to the gallows ; for though he go as softly as foot can fall , he thinks himself too soon there .</p>
   <p>Orl . Who stays it still withal ?</p>
   <p>Ros . With lawyers in the vacation ; for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how Time moves .</p>
   <p>Orl . Where dwell you , pretty youth ?</p>
   <p>Ros . With this shepherdess , my sister ; here in the skirts of the forest , like fringe upon a petticoat .</p>
   <p>Orl . Are you native of this place ?</p>
   <p>Ros . As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .</p>
   <p>Orl . Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so remov 'd a dwelling .</p>
   <p>Ros . I have been told so of many : but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man ; one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love . I have heard him read many lectures against it , and I thank God I am not a woman , to be touch 'd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax 'd their whole sex withal .</p>
   <p>Orl . Can you remember any of the principal evils laid to the charge of women ?</p>
   <p>Ros . There were none principal ; they were all like one another as half-pence are , every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it .</p>
   <p>Orl . I prithee , recount some of them .</p>
   <p>Ros . No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick . There is a man haunts the forest , that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks ; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind : if I could meet that fancy-monger , I would give him some good counsel , for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him .</p>
   <p>Orl . I am he that is so love-shak 'd : I pray you , tell me your remedy .</p>
   <p>Ros . There is none of my uncle 's marks upon you : he taught me how to know a man in love ; in which cage of rushes , I am sure , you are not prisoner .</p>
   <p>Orl . What were his marks ?</p>
   <p>Ros . A lean cheek , which you have not ; a blue eye , and sunken , which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit , which you have not ; a beard neglected , which you have not ; but I pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother 's revenue : then your hose should be ungarter 'd , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbutton 'd , your shoe unti 'd and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation ; but you are no such man ; you are rather point-device in your accoutrements , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .</p>
   <p>Orl . Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .</p>
   <p>Ros . Me believe it ? you may as soon make her that you love believe it ; which , I warrant , she is apter to do than to confess she does : that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences . But , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees , wherein Rosalind is so admired ?</p>
   <p>Orl . I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .</p>
   <p>Ros . But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?</p>
   <p>Orl . Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .</p>
   <p>Ros . Love is merely a madness ; and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do ; and the reason why they are not so punish 'd and cured is , that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too . Yet I profess curing it by counsel .</p>
   <p>Orl . Did you ever cure any so ?</p>
   <p>Ros . Yes , one ; and in this manner . He was to imagine me his love , his mistress ; and I set him every day to woo me : at which time would I , being but a moonish youth , be effeminate , changeable , longing and liking , proud , fantastical , apish , shallow , inconstant , full of tears , full of smiles , for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing , as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour ; would now like him , now loathe him ; then entertain him , then forswear him ; now weep for him , then spit at him ; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness ; which was , to forswear the full stream of the world , and to live in a nook merely monastic . And thus I cur 'd him ; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep 's heart , that there shall not be one spot of love i n't .</p>
   <p>Orl . I would not be cured , youth .</p>
   <p>Ros . I would cure you , if you would but call me Rosalind , and come every day to my cote and woo me .</p>
   <p>Orl . Now , by the faith of my love , I will : tell me where it is .</p>
   <p>Ros . Go with me to it , and I 'll show it you : and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live . Will you go ?</p>
   <p>Orl . With all my heart , good youth .</p>
   <p>Ros . Nay , you must call me Rosalind . Come , sister , will you go ?</p>

   <p>S. FERGUSON .</p>
   <p>SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS .</p>
   <p>1 . Sink or swim , live or die , survive or perish , I give my hand and my heart to this vote . It is true , indeed , that in the beginning we aimed not at independence . But there 's a divinity which shapes our ends . The injustice of England has driven us to arms ; and , blinded to her own interest for our good , she has obstinately persisted , till independence is now within our grasp . We have but to reach forth to it , and it is ours . Why , then , should we defer the Declaration ?</p>
   <p>2 . Is any man so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation with England , which shall leave either safety to the country and its liberties , or safety to his own life and his own honor ? Are not you , sir , who sit in that chair , is not he , our venerable colleague near you , are you not both already the prescribed and predestined objects of punishment and of vengeance ? Cut off from all hope of royal clemency , what are you , what can you be , while the power of England remains , but outlaws ?</p>
   <p>3 . If we postpone independence , do we mean to carry on or give up the war ? Do we mean to submit to the measures of Parliament , Boston Port Bill , and all ? Do we mean to submit , and consent that we ourselves shall be ground to powder , and our country and its rights trodden down in the dust ?</p>
   <p>4 . I know we do not mean to submit . We never shall submit . Do we intend to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered into by men , that plighting before God , of our sacred honor to Washington , when , putting him forth to incur the dangers of war , as well as the political hazards of the times , we promised to adhere to him , in every extremity , with our fortunes and our lives ?</p>
   <p>5 . I know there is not a man here , who would not rather see a general conflagration sweep over the land , or an earthquake sink it , than one jot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground . For myself , having , twelve months ago , in this place , moved you that George Washington be appointed commander of the forces raised , or to be raised , for the defence of American liberty , may my right hand forget her cunning , and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth , if I hesitate or waver in the support I give him .</p>
   <p>6 . The war , then , must go on . We must fight it through . And if the war must go on , why put off longer the Declaration of Independence ? That measure will strengthen us . It will give us character abroad . The nations will then treat with us , which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects in arms against our sovereign . Nay , I maintain that England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on the footing of independence , than consent , by repealing her acts , to acknowledge that her whole conduct towards us has been a course of injustice and oppression .</p>
   <p>7 . Her pride will be less wounded by submitting to that course of things which now predestinates our independence , than by yielding the points in controversy to her rebellious subjects . The former she would regard as the result of fortune ; the latter she would feel as her own deep disgrace . Why then , why then , sir , do we not as soon as possible change this from a civil to a national war ? And since we must fight it through , why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory , if we gain the victory ?</p>
   <p>8 . If we fail , it can be no worse for us . But we shall not fail . The cause will raise up armies ; the cause will create navies . The people , the people , if we are true to them , will carry us , and will carry themselves , gloriously through this struggle . I care not how fickle other people have been found . I know the people of these colonies , and I know that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their hearts , and cannot be eradicated . Every colony , indeed , has expressed its willingness to follow , if we but take the lead .</p>
   <p>9 . Sir , the Declaration will inspire the people with increased courage . Instead of a long and bloody war for the restoration of privileges , for redress of grievances , for chartered immunities held under a British king , set before them the glorious object of entire independence and it will breathe into them anew the breath of life .</p>
   <p>10 . Read this Declaration at the head of the army ; every sword will be drawn from its scabbard , and the solemn vow uttered , to maintain it , or to perish on the bed of honor . Publish it from the pulpit ; religion will approve it , and the love of religious liberty will cling round it , resolved to stand with it , or fall with it . Send it to the public halls ; proclaim it there ; let them hear it who heard the first roar of the enemy 's cannon ; let them see it who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill , and in the streets of Lexington and Concord , and the very walls will cry out in its support .</p>
   <p>11 . Sir , I know the uncertainty of human affairs , but I see , I see clearly through this day 's business . You and I , indeed , may rue it . We may not live to the time when this Declaration shall be made good . We may die ; die colonists ; die slaves ; die , it may be , ignominiously , and on the scaffold . Be it so . Be it so . If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life , the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice , come when that hour may . But while I do live , let me have a country , or at least the hope of a country , and that a free country .</p>
   <p>12 . But whatever may be our fate , be assured , be assured that this Declaration will stand . It may cost treasure and it may cost blood ; but it will stand , and it will richly compensate for both . Through the thick gloom of the present , I see the brightness of the future as the sun in heaven . We shall make this a glorious , an immortal day . When we are in our graves , our children will honor it . They will celebrate it with thanksgiving , with festivity , with bonfires , and illuminations . On its annual return , they will shed tears , copious , gushing tears , not of subjection and slavery , not of agony and distress , but of exultation , of gratitude , and of joy .</p>
   <p>13 . Sir , before God , I believe the hour is come . My judgment approves this measure , and my whole heart is in it . All that I have , and all that I am , and all that I hope in this life , I am now ready here to stake upon it ; and I leave off as I began , that , live or die , survive or perish , I am for the Declaration . It is my living sentiment , and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment ,— independence now , and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER !</p>

    <head>THE DODSON FAMILY .</head>
     <l n="1">From Mill on the Floss .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>PART I .</p>
   <p>1 . The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family , and Mrs. Glegg was not the least handsome of the sisters . As she sat in Mrs. Tulliver 's arm-chair , no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very comely face and figure . It is true she despised the advantages of costume , for though , as she often observed , no woman had better clothes , it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones . Other women , if they liked , might have their best thread-lace in every wash ; but when Mrs. Glegg died , it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her wardrobe , in the Spotted Chamber , than ever Mrs. Wooll of St. Ogg 's had bought in her life , although Mrs. Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for .</p>
   <p>2 . So of her curled fronts : to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy front , would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular . Occasionally , indeed , Mrs. Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a week-day visit , but not at a sister 's house ; especially not at Mrs. Tulliver 's , who , since her marriage , had hurt her sisters ’ feelings greatly by wearing her own hair . But Bessy was always weak !</p>
   <p>3 . So if Mrs. Glegg 's front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual , she had a design under it : she intended the most pointed and cutting allusion to Mrs. Tulliver 's bunches of blond curls , separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting . Mrs. Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg 's unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls , but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them , naturally administered support .</p>
   <p>4 . Mrs. Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house to-day — untied and tilted slightly , of course — a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit , and happened to be in a severe humor : she did n't know what draughts there might be in strange houses . For the same reason she wore a small sable tippet , which reached just to her shoulders , and was very far from meeting across her well-formed chest , while her long neck was protected by a chevaux-de-frise of miscellaneous frilling . One would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them Mrs. Glegg 's slate-colored silk gown must have been ; but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it , and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest , it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear .</p>
   <p>5 . Mrs. Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many-doubled chain round her fingers , and observed to Mrs. Tulliver , who had just returned from a visit to the kitchen , that whatever it might be by other people 's clocks and watches , it was gone half-past twelve by hers .</p>
   <p>6 . “ I do n't know what ails sister Pullet , ” she continued . “ It used to be the way in our family for one to be as early as another ,— I 'm sure it was so in my poor father 's time ,— and not for one sister to sit half an hour before the others came . But if the ways o ’ the family are altered , it sha n't be my fault — I 'll never be the one to come into a house when all the rest are going away . I wonder at sister Deane — she used to be more like me . But if you 'll take my advice , Bessy , you 'll put the dinner forrard a bit , sooner than put it back , because folks are late as ought to ha ’ known better . ”</p>
   <p>7 . “ Oh dear , there 's no fear but what they 'll be all here in time , sister , ” said Mrs. Tulliver , in her mild-peevish tone . “ The dinner wo n't be ready till half-past one . But if it 's long for you to wait , let me fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o ’ wine . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , Bessy ! ” said Mrs. Glegg , with a bitter smile , and a scarcely perceptible toss of her head , “ I should ha ’ thought you 'd known your own sister better . I never did eat between meals , and I 'm not going to begin . Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your dinner at half-past one , when you might have it at one . You was never brought up in that way , Bessy . ”</p>
   <p>8 . “ Why , Jane , what can I do ? Mr. Tulliver does n't like his dinner before two o'clock , but I put it half an hour earlier because o ’ you . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , yes , I know how it is with husbands — they 're for putting everything off — they 'll put the dinner off till after tea , if they 've got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work ; but it 's a pity for you , Bessy , as you have n't got more strength o ’ mind . It 'll be well if your children do n't suffer for it . And I hope you 've not gone and got a great dinner for us . A boiled joint , as you could make broth of for the kitchen , ” Mrs. Glegg added , in a tone of emphatic protest , “ and a plain pudding , with a spoonful o ’ sugar , and no spice , ‘ ud be far more becoming . ”</p>
   <p>9 . With sister Glegg in this humor , there was a cheerful prospect for the day . Mrs. Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her , but this point of the dinner was a tender one , and not at all new , so that she could make the same answer she had often made before .</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Tulliver says he always will have a good dinner for his friends while he can pay for it , ” she said , “ and he 's a right to do as he likes in his own house , sister . ”</p>
   <p>10 . “ Well , Bessy , I can n't leave your children enough out o ’ my savings , to keep ‘ em from ruin . And you must n't look to having any o ’ Mr. Glegg 's money , for it 's well if I do n't go first — he comes of a long-lived family ; and if he was to die and leave me well for my life , he 'd tie all the money up to go back to his own kin . ”</p>
   <p>11 . The sound of wheels while Mrs. Glegg was speaking was an interruption highly welcome to Mrs. Tulliver , who hastened out to receive sister Pullet — it must be sister Pullet , because the sound was that of a four-wheel .</p>
   <p>PART II .</p>
   <p>1 . Sister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before Mrs. Tulliver 's door , and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a few more before getting out , for though her husband and Mrs. Tulliver stood ready to support her , she sat still and shook her head sadly , as she looked through her tears at the vague distance . “ Why , whativer is the matter , sister ? ” said Mrs. Tulliver .</p>
   <p>2 . There was no reply but a further shake of the head , as Mrs. Pullet slowly rose and got down from the chaise , not without casting a glance at Mr. Pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from injury . Mr. Pullet was a small man with a high nose , small twinkling eyes , and thin lips , in a fresh-looking suit of black and a white cravat , that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher principle than that of mere personal ease .</p>
   <p>3 . It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilization — the sight of a fashionably drest female in grief . Perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast , she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward — a touching gesture , indicative , even in the deepest gloom , of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once more have a charm .</p>
   <p>4 . Mrs. Pullet brushed each doorpost with great nicety , about the latitude of her shoulders ( at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders ) , and having done that , sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlor where Mrs. Glegg was seated .</p>
   <p>5 . “ Well , sister , you 're late ; what 's the matter ? ” said Mrs. Glegg , rather sharply , as they shook hands .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Pullet sat down — lifting up her mantle carefully behind , before she answered —</p>
   <p>“ She 's gone . Died the day before yesterday , an ’ her legs was as thick as my body , ” she added , with deep sadness , after a pause . “ They 'd tapped her no end o ’ times , and the water — they say you might ha ’ swum in it , if you 'd liked . ”</p>
   <p>6 . “ Well , Sophy , it 's a mercy she 's gone , then , whoever she may be , ” said Mrs. Glegg , with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally clear and decided ; “ but I can n't think who you 're talking of , for my part . ”</p>
   <p>“ But I know , ” said Mrs. Pullet , sighing and shaking her head ; “ and there is n't another such a dropsy in the parish . I know as its old Mrs. Sutton o ’ the Twentylands . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , she 's no kin o ’ yours , nor much acquaintance as I 've ever heared of , ” said Mrs. Glegg , who always cried just as much as was proper when anything happened to her own “ kin , ” but not on other occasions .</p>
   <p>7 . “ She said to me , when I went to see her last Christmas , she said , ‘ Mrs. Pullet , if ever you have the dropsy , you 'll think o ’ me . ’ She did say so , ” added Mrs. Pullet , beginning to cry bitterly again ; “ those were her very words . And she 's to be buried o ’ Saturday , and Pullet 's bid to the funeral . ”</p>
   <p>“ Sophy , ” said Mrs. Glegg , unable any longer to contain her spirit of rational remonstrance — “ Sophy , I wonder at you , fretting and injuring your health about people as do n't belong to you . Your poor father never did so , nor your aunt Frances neither , nor any o ’ the family as I ever heard of . You could n't fret no more than this , if we 'd heared as our cousin Abbott had died sudden without making his will . ”</p>
   <p>8 . Mrs. Pullet was silent , having to finish her crying , and rather flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much .</p>
   <p>“ Ah ! ” she sighed , shaking her head at the idea that there were but few who could enter fully into her experiences . “ Sister , I may as well go and take my bonnet off now . Did you see as the cap-box was put out ? ” she added , turning to her husband .</p>
   <p>Mr. Pullet , by an unaccountable lapse of memory , had forgotten it , and hastened out , with a stricken conscience , to remedy the omission .</p>
   <p>9 . “ They 'll bring it up-stairs , sister , ” said Mrs. Tulliver , wishing to go at once , for she was fond of going up-stairs with her sister Pullet , and looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head , and discussing millinery in general . This was part of Bessy 's weakness , that stirred Mrs. Glegg 's sisterly compassion : Bessy went far too well drest , considering .</p>
   <p>But when Mrs. Pullet was alone with Mrs. Tulliver up-stairs , the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs. Glegg , and they agreed , in confidence , that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM WORDSWORTH .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER III .</p>
   <p>SLIDE IN VOLUME .</p>
   <p>FIRST BATTLES OF THE REVOLUTION .</p>
    <p>I .</p>
   <p>1 . We have cause for honest complacency , that when the distant citizen of our own republic , when the stranger from foreign lands , inquires for the spots where the noble blood of the Revolution began to flow , where the first battle of that great and glorious contest was fought , he is guided through the villages of Middlesex , to the plains of Lexington and Concord . It is a commemoration of our soil , to which ages , as they pass , will add dignity and interest ; till the names of Lexington and Concord in the annals of freedom , will stand by the side of the most honorable names in Roman or Grecian story .</p>
   <p>2 . It was one of those great days , one of those elemental occasions in the world 's affairs , when the people rise and act for themselves . Some organization and preparation had been made ; but from the nature of the case , with scarce any effect on the events of that day .</p>
   <p>3 . It may be doubted whether there was an efficient order given , the whole day , to any body of men as large as a regiment . It was the people , in their first capacity , as citizens and as freemen , starting from their beds at midnight , from their firesides and from their fields , to take their own cause into their own hands .</p>
   <p>4 . Such a spectacle is the height of the moral sublime ; when the want of everything is fully made up by the spirit of the cause , and the soul within stands in place of discipline , organization , and resources . In the prodigious efforts of a veteran army , beneath the dazzling splendor of their array , there is something revolting to the reflective mind .</p>
   <p>5 . The ranks are filled with the desperate , the mercenary , the depraved ; an iron slavery , by the name of subordination , merges the free will of one hundred thousand men in the unqualified despotism of one ; the humanity , mercy , and remorse , which scarce ever desert the individual bosom , are sounds without a meaning to that fearful , ravenous , irrational monster of prey , a mercenary army . It is hard to say who are most to be commiserated , the wretched people on whom it is let loose , or the still more wretched people whose substance has been sucked out to nourish it into strength and fury .</p>
   <p>6 . But in the efforts of the people ,— of the people struggling for their rights , moving , not in organized , disciplined masses , but in their spontaneous action , man for man , and heart for heart ,— there is something glorious . They can then move forward without orders , act together without combination , and brave the flaming lines of battle , without intrenchments to cover or walls to shield them .</p>
   <p>7 . No dissolute camp has worn off from the feelings of the youthful soldier the freshness of that home , where his mother and his sister sit waiting , with tearful eyes and aching hearts , to hear good news from the wars ; no long service in the ranks of a conqueror has turned the veteran 's heart into marble ; their valor springs not from recklessness , from habit , from indifference to the preservation of a life knit by no pledges to the life of others . But in the strength and spirit of the cause alone they act , they contend , they bleed . In this they conquer .</p>
   <p>8 . The people always conquer . They always must conquer . Armies may be defeated , kings may be overthrown , and new dynasties imposed , by foreign arms , on an ignorant and slavish race , that care not in what language the covenant of their subjection runs , nor in whose name the deed of their barter and sale is made out . But the people never invade ; and , when they rise against the invader , are never subdued .</p>
   <p>9 . If they are driven from the plains , they fly to the mountains . Steep rocks and everlasting hills are their castles ; the tangled , pathless thicket their palisado , and God is their ally . Now he overwhelms the hosts of their enemies beneath his drifting mountains of sand ; now he buries them beneath a falling atmosphere of polar snows ; he lets loose his tempests on their fleets ; he puts a folly into their counsels , a madness into the hearts of their leaders ; and never gave , and never will give , a final triumph over a virtuous and gallant people , resolved to be free .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT .</p>
   <p>NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY .</p>
   <p>FROM A SPEECH BEFORE THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF FRANCE , 1789 .</p>
   <p>1 . I hear much said of patriotism , appeals to patriotism , transports of patriotism . Gentlemen , why prostitute this noble world ? Is it so very magnanimous to give up a part of your income in order to save your whole property ? This is very simple arithmetic ; and he that hesitates , deserves contempt rather than indignation .</p>
   <p>2 . Yes , gentlemen , it is to your immediate self-interest , to your most familiar notions of prudence and policy that I now appeal . I say not to you now , as heretofore , beware how you give the world the first example of an assembled nation untrue to the public faith .</p>
   <p>3 . I ask you not , as heretofore , what right you have to freedom , or what means of maintaining it , if , at your first step in administration , you outdo in baseness all the old and corrupt governments . I tell you , that unless you prevent this catastrophe , you will all be involved in the general ruin ; and that you are yourselves the persons most deeply interested in making the sacrifices which the government demands of you .</p>
   <p>4 . I exhort you , then , most earnestly , to vote these extraordinary supplies ; and God grant they may prove sufficient ! Vote , then , I beseech you ; for , even if you doubt the expediency of the means , you know perfectly well that the supplies are necessary , and that you are incapable of raising them in any other way . Vote them at once , for the crisis does not admit of delay ; and , if it occurs , we must be responsible for the consequences .</p>
   <p>5 . Beware of asking for time . Misfortune accords it never . While you are lingering , the evil day will come upon you . Why , gentlemen , it is but a few days since , that upon occasion of some foolish bustle in the Palais Royal , some ridiculous insurrection that existed nowhere but in the heads of a few weak or designing individuals , we were told with emphasis , “ Catiline is at the gates of Rome , and yet we deliberate . ”</p>
   <p>6 . We know , gentlemen , that this was all imagination . We are far from being at Rome ; nor is there any Catiline at the gates of Paris . But now are we threatened with a real danger ; bankruptcy , national bankruptcy , is before you ; it threatens to swallow up your persons , your property , your honor ,— and yet you deliberate .</p>
   <p>MIRABEAU .</p>
   <p>THE LANTERN BEARERS .</p>
   <p>1 . These boys congregated every autumn about a certain easterly fisher-village , where they tasted in a high degree the glory of existence . The place was created seemingly on purpose for the diversion of young gentlemen . A street or two of houses , mostly red and many of them tiled ; a number of fine trees clustered about the manse and the kirkyard , and turning the chief street into a shady alley ; many little gardens more than usually bright with flowers ; nets a-drying , and fisher-wives scolding in the backward parts ; a smell of fish , a genial smell of seaweed ; whiffs of blowing sand at the street corners ; shops with golf-balls and bottled lollipops ; such , as well as memory serves me , were the ingredients of the town .</p>
   <p>2 . These , you are to conceive posted on a spit between two sandy bays , and sparsely flanked with villas — enough for the boys to lodge in with their subsidiary parents , not enough ( not yet enough ) to cocknify the scene ; a haven in the rocks in front : in front of that , a file of gray islets ; to the left , endless links and sand wreaths , a wilderness of hiding-holes , alive with popping rabbits and soaring gulls : to the right , a range of seaward crags , one rugged brow beyond another ; the ruins of a mighty and ancient fortress on the brink of one ; coves between — now charmed into sunshine quiet , now whistling with wind and clamorous with bursting surges ; the dens and sheltered hollows redolent of thyme and southernwood , the air at the cliff 's edge brisk and clean and pungent of the sea — in front of all , the Bass Rock , tilted seaward like a doubtful bather , the surf ringing it with white , the solan-geese hanging round its summit like a great and glittering smoke .</p>
   <p>3 . This choice piece of seaboard was sacred , besides , to the wrecker ; and the Bass , in the eye of fancy , still flew the colors of King James ; and in the ear of fancy the arches of Tantallon still rang with horse-shoe iron , and echoed to the commands of Bell — the — Cat .</p>
   <p>4 . ... But what my memory dwells upon the most was a sport peculiar to the place , and indeed to a week or so of our two months ’ holiday there . Maybe it still flourishes in its native spot ; for boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic forces inscrutable to man ; so that tops and marbles reappear in their due season , regular like the sun and moon ; and the harmless art of knuckle-bones has seen the fall of the Roman empire and the rise of the United States .</p>
   <p>5 . It may still flourish in its native spot , but nowhere else , I am persuaded ; for I tried myself to introduce it on Tweed-side , and was defeated lamentably ; its charm being quite local , like a country wine that cannot be exported .</p>
   <p>6 . The idle manner of it was this : Toward the end of September , when school-time was drawing near and the nights were already black , we would begin to sally from our respective villas , each equipped with a tin bull'shYpppHeNeye lantern . The thing was so well known that it had worn a rut in the commerce of Great Britain ; and the grocers , about the due time , began to garnish their windows with our particular brand of luminary . We wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket belt , and over them , such was the rigour of the game , a buttoned top-coat . They smelled noisomely of blistered tin ; they never burned aright , though they would always burn our fingers ; their use was naught ; the pleasure of them merely fanciful ; and yet a boy with a bull'shYpppHeNeye under his top-coat asked for nothing more .</p>
   <p>7 . The fishermen used lanterns about their boats , and it was from them , I suppose , that we had got the hint ; but theirs were not bull'shYpppHeNeyes , nor did we ever play at being fishermen . The police carried them at their belts , and we had plainly copied them in that ; yet we did not pretend to be policemen . Burglars , indeed , we may have had some haunting thoughts of ; and we had certainly an eye to past ages when lanterns were more common , and to certain story-books in which we had found them to figure very largely . But take it for all in all , the pleasure of the thing was substantive , and to be a boy with a bull'shYpppHeNeye under his top-coat was good enough for us .</p>
   <p>8 . When two of these asses met , there would be an anxious “ Have you got your lantern ? ” and a gratified “ Yes ! ” That was the shibboleth , and very needful too ; for , as it was the rule to keep our glory contained , none could recognize a lantern bearer , unless ( like the pole-cat ) by the smell . Four or five would sometimes climb into the belly of a ten-man lugger , with nothing but the thwarts above them — for the cabin was usually locked , or choose out some hollow of the links where the wind might whistle overhead . There the coats would be unbuttoned and the bull'shYpppHeNeyes discovered ; and in the chequering glimmer , under the huge windy hall of the night , and cheered by a rich steam of toasting tinware , these fortunate young gentlemen would crouch together in the cold sands of the links or on the scaly bilges of the fishing-boat , and delight themselves with inappropriate talk .</p>
   <p>9 . Woe is me that I may not give some specimens — some of their foresights of life , or deep inquiries into the rudiments of man and nature , these were so fiery and so innocent , they were so richly silly , so romantically young . But the talk at any rate was but a condiment ; and these gatherings themselves only accidents in the career of the lantern bearer . The essence of this bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night ; the slide shut , the top-coat buttoned ; not a ray escaping , whether to conduct your footsteps or to make your glory public : a mere pillar of darkness in the dark ; and all the while , deep down in the privacy of your fool 's heart , to know you had a bull'shYpppHeNeye at your belt , and to exult and sing over the knowledge .</p>

   <p>E. A. POE .</p>
   <p>THE TEMPERANCE QUESTION .</p>
   <p>1 . Some men look upon this temperance cause as a whining bigotry , narrow asceticism , or a vulgar sentimentality , fit for little minds , weak women , and weaker men . On the contrary , I regard it as second only to one or two others of the primary reforms of the age , and for this reason : every race has its peculiar temptation ; every clime has its specific sin .</p>
   <p>2 . The tropics and tropical races are tempted to one form of sensuality ; the colder and temperate regions , and our Saxon blood , find their peculiar temptation in the stimulus of drink and food . In old times our heaven was a drunken revel . We relieve ourselves from the over-weariness of constant and exhausting toil by intoxication . Science has brought a cheap means of drunkenness within the reach of every individual .</p>
   <p>3 . National prosperity and free institutions have put into the hands of almost every workman the means of being drunk for a week on the labor of two or three hours . With that blood and that temptation , we have adopted democratic institutions , where the law has no sanctions but the purpose and virtue of the masses . The statute book rests not on bayonets , as in Europe , but on the hearts of the people .</p>
   <p>4 . A drunken people can never be the basis of a free government . It is the corner-stone neither of virtue , prosperity , nor progress . To us , therefore , the title-deeds of whose estates , and the safety of whose lives depend upon the tranquility of the streets , upon the virtue of the masses , the presence of any vice which brutalizes the average mass of mankind , and tends to make it more readily the tool of intriguing and corrupt leaders , is necessarily a stab at the very life of the nation . Against such a vice is marshalled the Temperance Reformation .</p>
   <p>5 . That my sketch is no fancy picture every one of you knows . Every one of you can glance back over your own path , and count many and many a one among those who started from the goal at your side , with equal energy and perhaps greater promise , who has found a drunkard 's grave long before this . The brightness of the bar , the ornament of the pulpit , the hope and blessing and stay of many a family — you know , every one of you who has reached middle life , how often on your path you set up the warning , “ Fallen before the temptations of the street ! ”</p>
   <p>6 . Hardly one house in this city , whether it be full and warm with all the luxury of wealth , or whether it find hard , cold maintenance by the most earnest economy ; no matter which — hardly a house that does not count among sons or nephews some victim of this vice . The skeleton of this warning sits at every board . The whole world is kindred in this suffering . The country mother launches her boy with trembling upon the temptations of city life ; the father trusts his daughter anxiously to the young man she has chosen , knowing what a wreck intoxication may make of the house-tree they set up .</p>
   <p>7 . Alas ! how often are their worst forebodings more than fulfilled ! I have known a case — probably many of you recall some almost equal to it — where one worthy woman could count father , brother , husband , and son-in-law all drunkards — no man among her near kindred , except her son , who was not a victim of this vice . Like all other appetites , this finds resolution weak when set against the constant presence of temptation .</p>

    <head>THE PICKWICKIANS ON ICE .</head>
    <head>1 . “ Now , ” said Wardle , after a substantial lunch , with the agreeable items of strong beer and cherry-brandy , had been done ample justice to , “ what say you to an hour on the ice ? We shall have plenty of time . ”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Capital ! ” said Mr. Benjamin Allen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">“ Prime ! ” ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="3">“ You skate , of course , Winkle ? ” said Wardle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="4">2 . “ Ye — yes ; oh , yes ! ” replied Mr. Winkle . “ I — am rather out of</l>
     <l n="5">practice . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="6">“ Oh , do skate , Mr. Winkle , ” said Arabella . “ I like to see it so much ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="7">“ Oh , it is so graceful ! ” said another young lady .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="8">A third young lady said it was elegant , and a fourth expressed her</l>
     <l n="9">opinion that it was “ swan-like . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="10">3 . “ I should be very happy , I am sure , ” said Mr. Winkle , reddening ; “ but</l>
     <l n="11">I have no skates . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This objection was at once overruled . Trundle had got a couple of pair , and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more down-stairs ; whereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight , and looked exquisitely uncomfortable .</p>
   <p>4 . Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice ; and , the fat boy and Mr. Weller having shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the night , Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous , and described circles with his left leg , and cut figures of eight , and inscribed upon the ice , without once stopping for breath , a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices , to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick , Mr. Tupman , and the ladies ; which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen , assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer , performed some mystic evolutions , which they called a reel .</p>
   <p>5 . All this time Mr. Winkle , with his face and hands blue with the cold , had been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his feet , and putting his skates on with the points behind , and getting the straps into a very complicated and entangled state , with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass , who knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo . At length , however , with the assistance of Mr. Weller , the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on , and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet .</p>
   <p>6 . “ Now , then , sir , ” said Sam , in an encouraging tone , “ off with you , and show ‘ em how to do it . ”</p>
   <p>“ Stop , Sam , stop ! ” said Mr. Winkle , trembling violently , and clutching hold of Sam 's arms with the grasp of a drowning man . “ How slippery it is , Sam ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Not an uncommon thing upon ice , sir , ” replied Mr. Weller . “ Hold up , sir . ”</p>
   <p>This last observation of Mr. Weller 's bore reference to a demonstration Mr. Winkle made , at the instant , of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air , and dash the back of his head on the ice .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">7 . “ These — these — are very awkward skates , ai n't they , Sam ? ” inquired</l>
     <l n="2">Mr. Winkle , staggering .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ I 'm afeered there 's an orkard gen'lm ' n in ‘ em , sir , ” replied Sam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Now , Winkle , ” cried Mr. Pickwick , quite unconscious that there was</l>
     <l n="5">anything the matter . “ Come ; the ladies are all anxiety . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">“ Yes , yes , ” replied Mr. Winkle with a ghastly smile , “ I 'm coming . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">“ Just a-goin ’ to begin , ” said Sam , endeavoring to disengage himself .</l>
     <l n="8">“ Now , sir , start off . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>8 . “ Stop an instant , Sam , ” gasped Mr. Winkle , clinging most affectionately to Mr. Weller . “ I find I 've got a couple of coats at home that I do n't want , Sam . You may have them , Sam . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thankee , Sir , ” replied Mr. Weller .</p>
   <p>“ Never mind touching your hat , Sam , ” said Mr. Winkle hastily . “ You need n't take your hand away to do that . I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas-box , Sam . I 'll give it to you this afternoon , Sam . ”</p>
   <p>“ You 're wery good , sir , ” replied Mr. Weller .</p>
   <p>“ Just hold me at first , Sam , will you ? ” said Mr. Winkle . “ There , that 's right . I shall soon get in the way of it , Sam . Not too fast , Sam ; not too fast ! ”</p>
   <p>9 . Mr. Winkle stooping forward , with his body half doubled up , was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller , in a very singular and un-swan-like manner , when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank ,—</p>
   <p>“ Sam ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Sir ? ” said Mr. Weller .</p>
   <p>“ Here ! I want you . ”</p>
   <p>“ Let go , sir , ” said Sam ; “ do n't you hear the governor a-callin ’ ? Let go , sir . ”</p>
   <p>10 . With a violent effort Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of the agonized Pickwickian ; and , in so doing , administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle . With an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice could have insured , that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly down into the centre of the reel , at the very moment when Mr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty . Mr. Winkle struck wildly against him , and with a loud crash they fell heavily down . Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot . Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet ; but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind in skates . He was seated on the ice , making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance .</p>
   <p>11 . “ Are you hurt ? ” inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen with great anxiety .</p>
   <p>“ Not much , ” said Mr. Winkle , rubbing his back very hard .</p>
   <p>“ I wish you would let me bleed you , ” said Mr. Benjamin Allen with great eagerness .</p>
   <p>“ No , thank you , ” replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly .</p>
   <p>“ I really think you had better , ” said Mr. Allen .</p>
   <p>“ Thank you , ” replied Mr. Winkle , “ I 'd rather not . ”</p>
   <p>“ What do you think , Mr. Pickwick ? ” inquired Bob Sawyer .</p>
   <p>12 . Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant . He beckoned to Mr. Weller , and said in a stern voice , “ Take his skates off . ”</p>
   <p>“ No ; but really I had scarcely begun , ” remonstrated Mr. Winkle .</p>
   <p>“ Take his skates off , ” repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly .</p>
   <p>The command was not to be resisted . Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it in silence .</p>
   <p>“ Lift him up , ” said Mr. Pickwick . Sam assisted him to rise .</p>
   <p>13 . Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the by-standers ; and , beckoning his friend to approach , fixed a searching look upon him , and uttered in a low but distinct and emphatic tone , these remarkable words :</p>
   <p>“ You 're a humbug , sir . ”</p>
   <p>“ A what ? ” said Mr. Winkle , starting .</p>
   <p>“ A humbug , sir . I will speak plainer if you wish it . An imposter , sir . ”</p>
   <p>With these words Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel , and rejoined his friends .</p>
   <p>14 . While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just recorded , Mr. Weller and the fat boy , having by their joint endeavors cut out a slide , were exercising themselves thereupon in a very masterly and brilliant manner . Sam Weller , in particular , was displaying that beautiful feat of fancy sliding , which is currently denominated “ knocking at the cobbler 's door , ” and which is achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot , and occasionally giving a twopenny postman 's knock upon it with the other . It was a good long slide ; and there was something in the motion which Mr. Pickwick , who was very cold with standing still , could not help envying .</p>
   <p>15 . “ It looks a nice warm exercise , that , does n't it ? ” he inquired of Wardle , when that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath by reason of the indefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of compasses , and drawn complicated problems on the ice .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , it does , indeed , ” replied Wardle . “ Do you slide ? ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I used to do so on the gutters , when I was a boy , ” replied Mr .</l>
     <l n="2">Pickwick .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Try it now , ” said Wardle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Oh , do please , Mr. Pickwick ! ” cried all the ladies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">“ I should be very happy to afford you any amusement , ” replied Mr .</l>
     <l n="6">Pickwick ; “ but I have n't done such a thing these thirty years . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>16 . “ Pooh ! pooh ! nonsense ! ” said Wardle , dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterized all his proceedings . “ Here ! I 'll keep you company ; come along . ” And away went the good-tempered old fellow down the slide with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller , and beat the fat boy all to nothing .</p>
   <p>Mr. Pickwick paused , considered , pulled off his gloves , and put them in his hat , took two or three short runs , balked himself as often , and at last took another run , and went slowly and gravely down the slide , with his feet about a yard and a quarter apart , amidst the gratified shouts of all the spectators .</p>
   <p>17 . “ Keep the pot a-bilin ’ , sir , ” said Sam ; and down went Wardle again , and then Mr. Pickwick , and then Sam , and then Mr. Winkle , and then Mr. Bob Sawyer , and then the fat boy , and then Mr. Snodgrass , following closely upon each other 's heels , and running after each other with as much eagerness as if all their future prospects in life depended on their expedition .</p>
   <p>18 . It was the most intensely interesting thing to observe the manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony ; to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up ; to see him gradually expend the painful force which he had put on at first , and turn slowly round on the slide , with his face towards the point from which he started ; to contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished the distance , and the eagerness with which he turned round when he had done so , and ran after his predecessor , his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through the snow , and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness through his spectacles . And when he was knocked down , ( which happened upon the average every third round ) , it was the most invigorating sight that could possibly be imagined , to behold him gather up his hat , gloves , and handkerchief with a glowing countenance , and resume his station in the rank with an ardor and enthusiasm which nothing could abate .</p>
   <p>19 . The sport was at its height , the sliding was at the quickest , the laughter was at the loudest , when a sharp , smart crack was heard . There was a quick rush towards the bank , a wild scream from the ladies , and a shout from Mr. Tupman . A large mass of ice disappeared , the water bubbled up over it , and Mr. Pickwick 's hat , gloves , and handkerchief were floating on the surface ; and this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see .</p>
   <p>20 . Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance ; the males turned pale , and the females fainted ; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand , and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down , with frenzied eagerness ; while Mr. Tupman , by way of rendering the promptest assistance , and at the same time conveying to any person who might be within hearing the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe , ran off across the country at his utmost speed , screaming “ Fire ! ” with all his might and main .</p>
   <p>21 . It was at this very moment , when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the company generally , as an improving little bit of professional practice ,— it was at this very moment that a face , head , and shoulders emerged from beneath the water , and disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">22 . “ Keep yourself up for an instant , for only one instant , ” bawled Mr .</l>
     <l n="2">Snodgrass .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yes — do : let me implore you — for my sake , ” roared Mr. Winkle , deeply affected . The adjuration was rather unnecessary ; the probability being , that , if Mr. Pickwick had not decided to keep himself up for anybody else 's sake , it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so for his own .</p>
   <p>“ Do you feel the bottom there , old fellow ? ” said Wardle .</p>
   <p>“ Yes — certainly , ” replied Mr. Pickwick , wringing the water from his head and face , and gasping for breath . “ I fell upon my back . I could n't get on my feet at first . ”</p>
   <p>23 . The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick 's coat as was yet visible bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement ; and , as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy 's suddenly recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep , prodigies of valor were performed to get him out . After a vast quantity of splashing and cracking and struggling , Mr. Pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant situation , and once more stood on dry land .</p>
   <p>24 . Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up , and started off for home , presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman dripping wet , and without a hat , with his arms bound down to his sides , skimming over the ground without any clearly defined purpose , at the rate of six good English miles an hour .</p>

   <p>LORD MACAULAY .</p>
   <p>THE GLORIES OF MORNING .</p>
   <p>1 . I had occasion , a few weeks since , to take the early train from Providence to Boston ; and for this purpose rose at two o'clock in the morning . Everything around was wrapt in darkness and hushed in silence , broken only by what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and rush of the train . It was a mild , serene , midsummer 's night — the sky was without a cloud — the winds were whist . The moon , then in the last quarter , had just risen , and the stars shone with a spectral lustre but little affected by her presence . Jupiter two hours high , was the herald of the day ; the Pleiades , just above the horizon , shed their sweet influence in the east ; Lyra sparkled near the zenith ; the steady pointers , far beneath the pole , looked meekly up from the depths of the north to their sovereign .</p>
   <p>2 . Such was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train . As we proceeded , the timid approach of twilight became more perceptible ; the intense blue of the sky began to soften ; the smaller stars , like little children , went first to rest ; the sister-beams of the Pleiades soon melted together ; but the bright constellations of the west and north remained unchanged . Steadily the wondrous transfiguration went on . Hands of angels , hidden from mortal eyes , shifted the scenery of the heavens ; the glories of night dissolved into the glories of dawn .</p>
   <p>3 . The blue sky now turned more softly gray ; the great watch-stars shut up their holy eyes ; the east began to kindle . Faint streaks of purple soon blushed along the sky ; the whole celestial concave was filled with the inflowing tides of the morning light , which came pouring down from above in one great ocean of radiance ; till at length , as we reached the Blue Hills , a flash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon , and turned the dewy tear-drops of flower and leaf into rubies and diamonds . In a few seconds , the everlasting gates of the morning were thrown wide open , and the lord of day , arrayed in glories too severe for the gaze of man , began his state .</p>
   <p>4 . I do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians , who in the morning of the world went up to the hill-tops of Central Asia , and , ignorant of the true God , adored the most glorious work of his hand . But I am filled with amazement , when I am told , that , in this enlightened age and in the heart of the Christian world , there are persons who can witness this daily manifestation of the power and wisdom of the Creator , and yet say in their hearts , “ There is no God . ”</p>

   <p>O. W. HOLMES .</p>
   <p>AUTUMN .</p>
   <p>1 . Once more I am upon this serene hill-top ! The air is very clear , very still , and very solemn or , rather , tenderly sad , in its serene brightness . It is not that moist spring air , full of the smell of wood , of the soil , and of the odor of vegetation , which warm winds bring to us from the south .</p>
   <p>2 . It is not that summer atmosphere , full of alternations of haze and fervent clearness , as if Nature were calling into life every day some influence for its myriad children ; sometimes in showers , and sometimes with coercive heat upon root and leaf ; and , like a universal task-master , was driving up the hours to accomplish the labors of the year .</p>
   <p>3 . No ! In these autumn days there is a sense of leisure and of meditation . The sun seems to look down upon the labors of its fiery hands with complacency . Be satisfied , O seasonable Sun ! Thou hast shaped an ample year , and art garnering up harvests which well may swell thy rejoicing heart with gracious gladness .</p>
   <p>4 . One who breaks off in summer , and returns in autumn to the hills , needs almost to come to a new acquaintance with the most familiar things . It is another world ; or it is the old world a-masquerading ; and you halt , like one scrutinizing a disguised friend , between the obvious dissemblance and the subtile likeness .</p>
   <p>5 . Southward of our front door there stood two elms , leaning their branches toward each other , forming a glorious arch of green . Now , in faint yellow , they grow attenuated and seem as if departing ; they are losing their leaves and fading out of sight , as trees do in twilight . Yonder , over against that young growth of birch and evergreen , stood , all summer long , a perfect maple-tree , rounded out on every side , thick with luxuriant foliage , and dark with greenness , save when the morning sun , streaming through it , sent transparency to its very heart .</p>
   <p>6 . Now it is a tower of gorgeous red . So sober and solemn did it seem all summer , that I should think as soon to see a prophet dancing at a peasant 's holiday , as it transfigured to such intense gayety ! Its fellows , too , the birches and the walnuts , burn from head to foot with fires that glow but never consume .</p>
   <p>7 . But these holiday hills ! Have the evening clouds , suffused with sunset , dropped down and become fixed into solid forms ? Have the rainbows that followed autumn storms faded upon the mountains and left their mantles there ? Yet , with all their brilliancy , how modest do they seem ; how patient when bare , or burdened with winter ; how cheerful when flushed with summer-green , and how modest when they lift up their wreathed and crowned heads in the resplendent days of autumn !</p>
   <p>8 . I stand alone upon the peaceful summit of this hill , and turn in every direction . The east is all a-glow ; the blue north flushes all her hills with radiance ; the west stands in burnished armor ; the southern hills buckle the zone of the horizon together with emeralds and rubies , such as were never set in the fabled girdle of the gods ! Of gazing there cannot be enough . The hunger of the eye grows by feeding .</p>
   <p>9 . Only the brotherhood of evergreens — the pine , the cedar , the spruce , and the hemlock — refuse to join this universal revel . They wear their sober green through autumn and winter , as if they were set to keep open the path of summer through the whole year , and girdle all seasons together with a clasp of endless green .</p>
   <p>10 . But in vain do they give solemn examples to the merry leaves which frolic with every breeze that runs sweet riot in the glowing shades . Gay leaves will not be counselled , but will die bright and laughing . But both together — the transfigured leaves of deciduous trees and the calm unchangeableness of evergreens — how more beautiful are they than either alone ! The solemn pine brings color to the cheek of the beeches , and the scarlet and golden maples rest gracefully upon the dark foliage of the million-fingered pine .</p>
   <p>11 . Lifted far above all harm of fowler or impediment of mountain , wild fowl are steadily flying southward . The simple sight of them fills the imagination with pictures . They have all summer long called to each other from the reedy fens and wild oat-fields of the far north . Summer is already extinguished there .</p>
   <p>12 . Winter is following their track , and marching steadily toward us . The spent flowers , the seared leaves , the thinning tree-tops , the morning frost , have borne witness of a change on earth ; and these caravans of the upper air confirm the tidings . Summer is gone ; winter is coming !</p>
   <p>13 . The wind has risen to-day . It is not one of those gusty , playful winds that frolic with the trees . It is a wind high up in air , that moves steadily , with a solemn sound , as if it were the spirit of summer journeying past us ; and , impatient of delay , it does not stoop to the earth , but touches the tops of the trees , with a murmuring sound , sighing a sad farewell and passing on .</p>
   <p>14 . Such days fill one with pleasant sadness . How sweet a pleasure is there in sadness ! It is not sorrow ; it is not despondency ; it is not gloom ! It is one of the moods of joy . At any rate I am very happy , and yet it is sober , and very sad happiness . It is the shadow of joy upon the soul ! I can reason about these changes . I can cover over the dying leaves with imaginations as bright as their own hues ; and , by Christian faith , transfigure the whole scene with a blessed vision of joyous dying and glorious resurrection .</p>
   <p>15 . But what then ? Such thoughts glow like evening clouds , and not far beneath them are the evening twilights , into whose dusk they will soon melt away . And all communions , and all admirations , and all associations , celestial or terrene , come alike into a pensive sadness , that is even sweeter than our joy . It is the minor key of our thoughts .</p>

      <l n="1">Untremulous in the river clear ,</l>
      <l n="2">Toward the sky 's image , hangs the imaged bridge ;</l>
      <l n="3">So still the air that I can hear</l>
      <l n="4">The slender clarion of the unseen midge ;</l>
      <l n="5">Out of the stillness , with a gathering creep ,</l>
      <l n="6">Like rising wind in leaves , which now decreases ,</l>
      <l n="7">Now lulls , now swells , and all the while increases ,</l>
      <l n="8">The huddling trample of a drove of sheep</l>
      <l n="9">Tilts the loose planks , and then as gradually ceases</l>
      <l n="10">In dust on the other side ; life 's emblem deep ,</l>
      <l n="11">A confused noise between two silences ,</l>
      <l n="12">Finding at last in dust precarious peace .</l>

      <l n="13">On the wide marsh the purple-blossomed grasses</l>
      <l n="14">Soak up the sunshine ; sleeps the brimming tide ,</l>
      <l n="15">Save when the wedge-shaped wake in silence passes</l>
      <l n="16">Of some slow water-rat , whose sinuous glide</l>
      <l n="17">Wavers the long green sedge 's shade from side to side ;</l>
      <l n="18">But up the west , like a rock-shivered surge ,</l>
      <l n="19">Climbs a great cloud edged with sun-whitened spray ;</l>
      <l n="20">Huge whirls of foam boil toppling o'er its verge ,</l>
      <l n="21">And falling still it seems , and yet it climbs alway .</l>

      <l n="22">Suddenly all the sky is hid</l>
      <l n="23">As with the shutting of a lid ,</l>
      <l n="24">One by one great drops are falling</l>
      <l n="25">Doubtful and slow ,</l>
      <l n="26">Down the pane they are crookedly crawling ,</l>
      <l n="27">And the wind breathes low ;</l>
      <l n="28">Slowly the circles widen on the river ,</l>
      <l n="29">Widen and mingle , one and all ;</l>
      <l n="30">Here and there the slenderer flowers shiver ,</l>
      <l n="31">Struck by an icy rain-drop 's fall .</l>

      <l n="32">Now on the hills I hear the thunder mutter ,</l>
      <l n="33">The wind is gathering in the west ;</l>
      <l n="34">The upturned leaves first whiten and flutter ,</l>
      <l n="35">Then droop to a fitful rest ;</l>
      <l n="36">Up from the stream with sluggish flap</l>
      <l n="37">Struggles the gull and floats away ;</l>
      <l n="38">Nearer and nearer rolls the thunder-clap ,</l>
      <l n="39">We shall not see the sun go down to-day :</l>
      <l n="40">Now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh ,</l>
      <l n="41">And tramples the grass with terrified feet ,</l>
      <l n="42">The startled river turns leaden and harsh .</l>
      <l n="43">You can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat .</l>

      <l n="44">Look ! look ! that livid flash !</l>
      <l n="45">And instantly follows the rattling thunder ,</l>
      <l n="46">As if some cloud-crag , split asunder ,</l>
      <l n="47">Fell , splintering with a ruinous crash ,</l>
      <l n="48">On the Earth , which crouches in silence under ;</l>
      <l n="49">And now a solid gray wall of rain</l>
      <l n="50">Shuts off the landscape , mile by mile ;</l>
      <l n="51">For a breath 's space I see the blue wood again ,</l>
      <l n="52">And , ere the next heart-beat , the wind-hurled pile ,</l>
      <l n="53">That seemed but now a league aloof ,</l>
      <l n="54">Bursts crackling o'er the sun-parched roof ;</l>
      <l n="55">Against the windows the storm comes dashing ,</l>
      <l n="56">Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing ,</l>
      <l n="57">The blue lightning flashes ,</l>
      <l n="58">The rapid hail clashes ,</l>
      <l n="59">The white waves are tumbling ,</l>
      <l n="60">And , in one baffled roar ,</l>
      <l n="61">Like the toothless sea mumbling</l>
      <l n="62">A rock-bristled shore ,</l>
      <l n="63">The thunder is rumbling</l>
      <l n="64">And crashing and crumbling ,—</l>
      <l n="65">Will silence return never more ?</l>

      <l n="66">Hush ! Still as death ,</l>
      <l n="67">The tempest holds his breath</l>
      <l n="68">As from a sudden will ;</l>
      <l n="69">The rain stops short , but from the eaves</l>
      <l n="70">You see it drop , and hear it from the leaves ,</l>
      <l n="71">All is so bodingly still ;</l>
      <l n="72">Again , now , now , again</l>
      <l n="73">Plashes the rain in heavy gouts ,</l>
      <l n="74">The crinkled lightning</l>
      <l n="75">Seems ever brightening ,</l>
      <l n="76">And loud and long</l>
      <l n="77">Again the thunder shouts</l>
      <l n="78">His battle-song ,—</l>
      <l n="79">One quivering flash ,</l>
      <l n="80">One wildering crash ,</l>
      <l n="81">Followed by silence dead and dull ,</l>
      <l n="82">As if the cloud , let go ,</l>
      <l n="83">Leapt bodily below</l>
      <l n="84">To whelm the earth in one mad overthrow ,</l>
      <l n="85">And then a total lull .</l>

      <l n="86">Gone , gone , so soon !</l>
      <l n="87">No more my half-crazed fancy there</l>
      <l n="88">Can shape a giant in the air ,</l>
      <l n="89">No more I see his streaming hair ,</l>
      <l n="90">The writhing portent of his form ;</l>
      <l n="91">The pale and quiet moon</l>
      <l n="92">Makes her calm forehead bare ,</l>
      <l n="93">And the last fragments of the storm ,</l>
      <l n="94">Like shattered rigging from a fight at sea ,</l>
      <l n="95">Silent and few , are drifting over me .</l>

    <head>JAQUES ’ SEVEN AGES OF MAN .</head>
     <l n="1">All the world 's a stage ,</l>
     <l n="2">And all the men and women merely players :</l>
     <l n="3">They have their exits , and their entrances ;</l>
     <l n="4">And one man in his time plays many parts ,</l>
     <l n="5">His acts being seven ages . At first , the infant ,</l>
     <l n="6">Mewling and puking in the nurse 's arms .</l>
     <l n="7">And then , the whining school-boy , with his satchel ,</l>
     <l n="8">And shining morning face , creeping , like snail ,</l>
     <l n="9">Unwillingly to school . And then the lover ,</l>
     <l n="10">Sighing like furnace , with a woeful ballad</l>
     <l n="11">Made to his mistress ’ eyebrow . Then the soldier ,</l>
     <l n="12">Full of strange oaths , and bearded like a pard ,</l>
     <l n="13">Jealous in honor , sudden and quick in quarrel ,</l>
     <l n="14">Seeking the bubble reputation</l>
     <l n="15">Even in the cannon 's mouth . And then , the justice ,</l>
     <l n="16">In fair round belly , with good capon lin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">With eyes severe , and beard of formal cut ,</l>
     <l n="18">Full of wise saws and modern instances ,</l>
     <l n="19">And so he plays his part . The sixth age shifts</l>
     <l n="20">Into the lean and slipper 'd pantaloon ,</l>
     <l n="21">With spectacles on nose , and pouch on side ;</l>
     <l n="22">His youthful hose well sav 'd , a world too wide</l>
     <l n="23">For his shrunk shank ; and his big manly voice ,</l>
     <l n="24">Turning again toward childish treble , pipes</l>
     <l n="25">And whistles in his sound . Last scene of all ,</l>
     <l n="26">That ends this strange , eventful history ,</l>
     <l n="27">Is second childishness , and mere oblivion ;</l>
     <l n="28">Sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .</l>
