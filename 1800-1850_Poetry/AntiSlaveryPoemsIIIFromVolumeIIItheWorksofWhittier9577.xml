THE PASS OF THE SIERRA A SONG FOR THE TIME WHAT OF THE DAY ? A SONG , INSCRIBED TO THE FREMONT CLUBS THE PANORAMA ON A PRAYER-BOOK THE SUMMONS TO WILLIAM H. SEWARD</item>
     <item>DERNE .</item>
     <item>The storming of the city of Derne , in 1805 , by General Eaton , at the head of nine Americans , forty Greeks , and a motley array of Turks and Arabs , was one of those feats of hardihood and daring which have in all ages attracted the admiration of the multitude . The higher and holier heroism of Christian self-denial and sacrifice , in the humble walks of private duty , is seldom so well appreciated .</item>
     <item>NIGHT on the city of the Moor ! On mosque and tomb , and white-walled shore , On sea-waves , to whose ceaseless knock The narrow harbor-gates unlock , On corsair 's galley , carack tall , And plundered Christian caraval ! The sounds of Moslem life are still ; No mule-bell tinkles down the hill ; Stretched in the broad court of the khan , The dusty Bornou caravan Lies heaped in slumber , beast and man ; The Sheik is dreaming in his tent , His noisy Arab tongue o'erspent ; The kiosk 's glimmering lights are gone , The merchant with his wares withdrawn ; Rough pillowed on some pirate breast , The dancing-girl has sunk to rest ; And , save where measured footsteps fall Along the Bashaw 's guarded wall , Or where , like some bad dream , the Jew Creeps stealthily his quarter through , Or counts with fear his golden heaps , The City of the Corsair sleeps .</item>
     <item>But where yon prison long and low Stands black against the pale star-glow , Chafed by the ceaseless wash of waves , There watch and pine the Christian slaves ; Rough-bearded men , whose far-off wives Wear out with grief their lonely lives ; And youth , still flashing from his eyes The clear blue of New England skies , A treasured lock of whose soft hair Now wakes some sorrowing mother 's prayer ; Or , worn upon some maiden breast , Stirs with the loving heart 's unrest .</item>
     <item>A bitter cup each life must drain , The groaning earth is cursed with pain , And , like the scroll the angel bore The shuddering Hebrew seer before , O'erwrit alike , without , within , With all the woes which follow sin ; But , bitterest of the ills beneath Whose load man totters down to death , Is that which plucks the regal crown Of Freedom from his forehead down , And snatches from his powerless hand The sceptred sign of self-command , Effacing with the chain and rod The image and the seal of God ; Till from his nature , day by day , The manly virtues fall away , And leave him naked , blind and mute , The godlike merging in the brute !</item>
     <item>Why mourn the quiet ones who die Beneath affection 's tender eye , Unto their household and their kin Like ripened corn-sheaves gathered in ? O weeper , from that tranquil sod , That holy harvest-home of God , Turn to the quick and suffering , shed Thy tears upon the living dead Thank God above thy dear ones ’ graves , They sleep with Him , they are not slaves .</item>
     <item>What dark mass , down the mountain-sides Swift-pouring , like a stream divides ? A long , loose , straggling caravan , Camel and horse and armed man . The moon 's low crescent , glimmering o'er Its grave of waters to the shore , Lights tip that mountain cavalcade , And gleams from gun and spear and blade Near and more near ! now o'er them falls The shadow of the city walls . Hark to the sentry 's challenge , drowned In the fierce trumpet 's charging sound ! The rush of men , the musket 's peal , The short , sharp clang of meeting steel !</item>
     <item>Vain , Moslem , vain thy lifeblood poured So freely on thy foeman 's sword ! Not to the swift nor to the strong The battles of the right belong ; For he who strikes for Freedom wears The armor of the captive 's prayers , And Nature proffers to his cause The strength of her eternal laws ; While he whose arm essays to bind And herd with common brutes his kind Strives evermore at fearful odds With Nature and the jealous gods , And dares the dread recoil which late Or soon their right shall vindicate .</item>
     <item>‘ T is done , the horned crescent falls The star-flag flouts the broken walls Joy to the captive husband ! joy To thy sick heart , O brown-locked boy ! In sullen wrath the conquered Moor Wide open flings your dungeon-door , And leaves ye free from cell and chain , The owners of yourselves again . Dark as his allies desert-born , Soiled with the battle 's stain , and worn With the long marches of his band Through hottest wastes of rock and sand , Scorched by the sun and furnace-breath Of the red desert 's wind of death , With welcome words and grasping hands , The victor and deliverer stands !</item>

    <docDate>The tale is one of distant skies ; The dust of half a century lies Upon it ; yet its hero 's name Still lingers on the lips of Fame . Men speak the praise of him who gave Deliverance to the Moorman 's slave , Yet dare to brand with shame and crime The heroes of our land and time ,— The self-forgetful ones , who stake Home , name , and life for Freedom 's sake . God mend his heart who cannot feel The impulse of a holy zeal , And sees not , with his sordid eyes , The beauty of self-sacrifice Though in the sacred place he stands , Uplifting consecrated hands , Unworthy are his lips to tell Of Jesus ’ martyr-miracle , Or name aright that dread embrace Of suffering for a fallen race !<date>1850</date>. A SABBATH SCENE . This poem finds its justification in the readiness with which , even in the North , clergymen urged the prompt execution of the Fugitive Slave Law as a Christian duty , and defended the system of slavery as a Bible institution . SCARCE had the solemn Sabbath-bell Ceased quivering in the steeple , Scarce had the parson to his desk Walked stately through his people , When down the summer-shaded street A wasted female figure , With dusky brow and naked feet , Came rushing wild and eager . She saw the white spire through the trees , She heard the sweet hymn swelling O pitying Christ ! a refuge give That poor one in Thy dwelling ! Like a scared fawn before the hounds , Right up the aisle she glided , While close behind her , whip in hand , A lank-haired hunter strided . She raised a keen and bitter cry , To Heaven and Earth appealing ; Were manhood 's generous pulses dead ? Had woman 's heart no feeling ? A score of stout hands rose between The hunter and the flying : Age clenched his staff , and maiden eyes Flashed tearful , yet defying .</docDate>

     <p>“ Who dares profane this house and day ? ” Cried out the angry pastor . “ Why , bless your soul , the wench 's a slave , And I 'm her lord and master ! “ I 've law and gospel on my side , And who shall dare refuse me ? ” Down came the parson , bowing low , “ My good sir , pray excuse me ! “ Of course I know your right divine To own and work and whip her ; Quick , deacon , throw that Polyglott Before the wench , and trip her ! ” Plump dropped the holy tome , and o'er Its sacred pages stumbling , Bound hand and foot , a slave once more , The hapless wretch lay trembling . I saw the parson tie the knots , The while his flock addressing , The Scriptural claims of slavery With text on text impressing . “ Although , ” said he , “ on Sabbath day All secular occupations Are deadly sins , we must fulfil Our moral obligations : “ And this commends itself as one To every conscience tender ; As Paul sent back Onesimus , My Christian friends , we send her ! ” Shriek rose on shriek ,— the Sabbath air Her wild cries tore asunder ; I listened , with hushed breath , to hear God answering with his thunder ! All still ! the very altar 's cloth Had smothered down her shrieking , And , dumb , she turned from face to face , For human pity seeking ! I saw her dragged along the aisle , Her shackles harshly clanking ; I heard the parson , over all , The Lord devoutly thanking ! My brain took fire : “ Is this , ” I cried , “ The end of prayer and preaching ? Then down with pulpit , down with priest , And give us Nature 's teaching ! “ Foul shame and scorn be on ye all Who turn the good to evil , And steal the Bible , from the Lord , To give it to the Devil ! “ Than garbled text or parchment law I own a statute higher ; And God is true , though every book And every man 's a liar ! ” Just then I felt the deacon 's hand In wrath my coattail seize on ; I heard the priest cry , “ Infidel ! ” The lawyer mutter , “ Treason ! ” I started up ,— where now were church , Slave , master , priest , and people ? I only heard the supper-bell , Instead of clanging steeple . But , on the open window 's sill , O'er which the white blooms drifted , The pages of a good old Book The wind of summer lifted , And flower and vine , like angel wings Around the Holy Mother , Waved softly there , as if God 's truth And Mercy kissed each other . And freely from the cherry-bough Above the casement swinging , With golden bosom to the sun , The oriole was singing . As bird and flower made plain of old The lesson of the Teacher , So now I heard the written Word Interpreted by Nature .</p>

    <docDate>For to my ear methought the breeze Bore Freedom 's blessed word on ; Thus saith the Lord : Break every yoke , Undo the heavy burden<date>1850</date>. IN THE EVIL DAYS . This and the four following poems have special reference to that darkest hour in the aggression of slavery which preceded the dawn of a better day , when the conscience of the people was roused to action . THE evil days have come , the poor Are made a prey ; Bar up the hospitable door , Put out the fire-lights , point no more The wanderer 's way . For Pity now is crime ; the chain Which binds our States Is melted at her hearth in twain , Is rusted by her tears ’ soft rain Close up her gates .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Our Union , like a glacier stirred By voice below , Or bell of kine , or wing of bird , A beggar 's crust , a kindly word May overthrow ! Poor , whispering tremblers ! yet we boast Our blood and name ; Bursting its century-bolted frost , Each gray cairn on the Northman 's coast Cries out for shame ! Oh for the open firmament , The prairie free , The desert hillside , cavern-rent , The Pawnee 's lodge , the Arab 's tent , The Bushman 's tree ! Than web of Persian loom most rare , Or soft divan , Better the rough rock , bleak and bare , Or hollow tree , which man may share With suffering man . I hear a voice : “ Thus saith the Law , Let Love be dumb ; Clasping her liberal hands in awe , Let sweet-lipped Charity withdraw From hearth and home . ” I hear another voice : “ The poor Are thine to feed ; Turn not the outcast from thy door , Nor give to bonds and wrong once more Whom God hath freed . ” Dear Lord ! between that law and Thee No choice remains ; Yet not untrue to man 's decree , Though spurning its rewards , is he Who bears its pains . Not mine Sedition 's trumpet-blast And threatening word ; I read the lesson of the Past , That firm endurance wins at last More than the sword .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>O clear-eyed Faith , and Patience thou So calm and strong ! Lend strength to weakness , teach us how The sleepless eyes of God look through This night of wrong<date>1850</date>. MOLOCH IN STATE STREET .</docDate>
    <docImprint>In a foot-note of the Report of the Senate of Massachusetts on the case of the arrest and return to bondage of the fugitive slave Thomas Sims it is stated that — “ It would have been impossible for the U. S. marshal thus successfully to have resisted the law of the State , without the assistance of the municipal authorities of<settlement>Boston</settlement>, and the countenance and support of a numerous , wealthy , and powerful body of citizens . It was in evidence that<date>1500</date>of the most wealthy and respectable citizens-merchants , bankers , and others — volunteered their services to aid the marshal on this occasion . . . . No watch was kept upon the doings of the marshal , and while the State officers slept , after the moon had gone down , in the darkest hour before daybreak , the accused was taken out of our jurisdiction by the armed police of the city of<settlement>Boston</settlement>. ” THE moon has set : while yet the dawn Breaks cold and gray , Between the midnight and the morn Bear off your prey ! On , swift and still ! the conscious street Is panged and stirred ; Tread light ! that fall of serried feet The dead have heard ! The first drawn blood of Freedom 's veins Gushed where ye tread ; Lo ! through the dusk the martyr-stains Blush darkly red ! Beneath the slowly waning stars And whitening day , What stern and awful presence bars That sacred way ? What faces frown upon ye , dark With shame and pain ? Come these from Plymouth 's Pilgrim bark ? Is that young Vane ? Who , dimly beckoning , speed ye on With mocking cheer ? Lo ! spectral Andros , Hutchinson , And Gage are here ! For ready mart or favoring blast Through Moloch 's fire , Flesh of his flesh , unsparing , passed The Tyrian sire . Ye make that ancient sacrifice Of Mail to Gain , Your traffic thrives , where Freedom dies , Beneath the chain . Ye sow to-day ; your harvest , scorn And hate , is near ; How think ye freemen , mountain-born , The tale will hear ? Thank God ! our mother State can yet Her fame retrieve ; To you and to your children let The scandal cleave . Chain Hall and Pulpit , Court and Press , Make gods of gold ; Let honor , truth , and manliness Like wares be sold . Your hoards are great , your walls are strong , But God is just ; The gilded chambers built by wrong Invite the rust . What ! know ye not the gains of Crime Are dust and dross ; Its ventures on the waves of time Foredoomed to loss ! And still the Pilgrim State remains What she hath been ; Her inland hills , her seaward plains , Still nurture men ! Nor wholly lost the fallen mart ; Her olden blood Through many a free and generous heart Still pours its flood . That brave old blood , quick-flowing yet , Shall know no check , Till a free people 's foot is set On Slavery 's neck . Even now , the peal of bell and gun , And hills aflame , Tell of the first great triumph won In Freedom 's name .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></docImprint>
    <docDate>The long night dies : the welcome gray Of dawn we see ; Speed up the heavens thy perfect day , God of the free !<date>1851</date>. OFFICIAL PIETY . Suggested by reading a state paper , wherein the higher law is invoked to sustain the lower one . A Pious magistrate ! sound his praise throughout The wondering churches . Who shall henceforth doubt That the long-wished millennium draweth nigh ? Sin in high places has become devout , Tithes mint , goes painful-faced , and prays its lie Straight up to Heaven , and calls it piety ! The pirate , watching from his bloody deck The weltering galleon , heavy with the gold Of Acapulco , holding death in check While prayers are said , brows crossed , and beads are told ; The robber , kneeling where the wayside cross On dark Abruzzo tells of life 's dread loss From his own carbine , glancing still abroad For some new victim , offering thanks to God ! Rome , listening at her altars to the cry Of midnight Murder , while her hounds of hell Scour France , from baptized cannon and holy bell And thousand-throated priesthood , loud and high , Pealing Te Deums to the shuddering sky , “ Thanks to the Lord , who giveth victory ! ” What prove these , but that crime was ne'er so black As ghostly cheer and pious thanks to lack ? Satan is modest . At Heaven 's door he lays His evil offspring , and , in Scriptural phrase And saintly posture , gives to God the praise And honor of the monstrous progeny . What marvel , then , in our own time to see His old devices , smoothly acted o'er ,— Official piety , locking fast the door Of Hope against three million soups of men ,— Brothers , God 's children , Christ 's redeemed ,— and then , With uprolled eyeballs and on bended knee , Whining a prayer for help to hide the key !<date>1853</date>.</docDate>
    <docImprint>THE RENDITION . On the 2d of June ,<date>1854</date>, Anthony Burns , a fugitive slave from Virginia , after being under arrest for ten days in the<settlement>Boston</settlement>Court House , was remanded to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Act , and taken down State Street to a steamer chartered by the<country>United States</country>Government , under guard of<country>United States</country>troops and artillery , Massachusetts militia and<settlement>Boston</settlement>police . Public excitement ran high , a futile attempt to rescue Burns having been made during his confinement , and the streets were crowded with tens of thousands of people , of whom many came from other towns and cities of the State to witness the humiliating spectacle . I HEARD the train 's shrill whistle call , I saw an earnest look beseech , And rather by that look than speech My neighbor told me all . And , as I thought of Liberty Marched handcuffed down that sworded street , The solid earth beneath my feet Reeled fluid as the sea . I felt a sense of bitter loss ,— Shame , tearless grief , and stifling wrath , And loathing fear , as if my path A serpent stretched across . All love of home , all pride of place , All generous confidence and trust , Sank smothering in that deep disgust And anguish of disgrace . Down on my native hills of June , And home 's green quiet , hiding all , Fell sudden darkness like the fall Of midnight upon noon . And Law , an unloosed maniac , strong , Blood-drunken , through the blackness trod , Hoarse-shouting in the ear of God The blasphemy of wrong . “ O Mother , from thy memories proud , Thy old renown , dear Commonwealth , Lend this dead air a breeze of health , And smite with stars this cloud . “ Mother of Freedom , wise and brave , Rise awful in thy strength , ” I said ; Ah me ! I spake but to the dead ; I stood upon her grave ! 6th mo .,<date>1854</date>. ARISEN AT LAST . On the passage of the bill to protect the rights and liberties of the people of the State against the Fugitive Slave Act . I SAID I stood upon thy grave , My Mother State , when last the moon Of blossoms clomb the skies of June . And , scattering ashes on my head , I wore , undreaming of relief , The sackcloth of thy shame and grief . Again that moon of blossoms shines On leaf and flower and folded wing , And thou hast risen with the spring ! Once more thy strong maternal arms Are round about thy children flung ,— A lioness that guards her young ! No threat is on thy closed lips , But in thine eye a power to smite The mad wolf backward from its light . Southward the baffled robber 's track Henceforth runs only ; hereaway , The fell lycanthrope finds no prey . Henceforth , within thy sacred gates , His first low howl shall downward draw The thunder of thy righteous law . Not mindless of thy trade and gain , But , acting on the wiser plan , Thou'rt grown conservative of man . So shalt thou clothe with life the hope , Dream-painted on the sightless eyes Of him who sang of Paradise ,— The vision of a Christian man , In virtue , as in stature great Embodied in a Christian State . And thou , amidst thy sisterhood Forbearing long , yet standing fast , Shalt win their grateful thanks at last ; When North and South shall strive no more , And all their feuds and fears be lost In Freedom 's holy Pentecost . 6th mo .,<date>1855</date>. THE HASCHISH . OF all that Orient lands can vaunt Of marvels with our own competing , The strangest is the Haschish plant , And what will follow on its eating . What pictures to the taster rise , Of Dervish or of Almeh dances ! Of Eblis , or of Paradise , Set all aglow with Houri glances ! The poppy visions of Cathay , The heavy beer-trance of the Suabian ; The wizard lights and demon play Of nights Walpurgis and Arabian ! The Mollah and the Christian dog Change place in mad metempsychosis ; The Muezzin climbs the synagogue , The Rabbi shakes his beard at Moses ! The Arab by his desert well Sits choosing from some Caliph 's daughters , And hears his single camel 's bell Sound welcome to his regal quarters . The Koran 's reader makes complaint Of Shitan dancing on and off it ; The robber offers alms , the saint Drinks Tokay and blasphemes the Prophet . Such scenes that Eastern plant awakes ; But we have one ordained to beat it , The Haschish of the West , which makes Or fools or knaves of all who eat it . The preacher eats , and straight appears His Bible in a new translation ; Its angels negro overseers , And Heaven itself a snug plantation ! The man of peace , about whose dreams The sweet millennial angels cluster , Tastes the mad weed , and plots and schemes , A raving Cuban filibuster ! The noisiest Democrat , with ease , It turns to Slavery 's parish beadle ; The shrewdest statesman eats and sees Due southward point the polar needle . The Judge partakes , and sits erelong Upon his bench a railing blackguard ; Decides off-hand that right is wrong , And reads the ten commandments backward .</docImprint>
    <docDate>O potent plant ! so rare a taste Has never Turk or Gentoo gotten ; The hempen Haschish of the East Is powerless to our Western Cotton !<date>1854</date>. FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS ’ SAKE .</docDate>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>Inscribed to friends under arrest for treason against the slave power . THE age is dull and mean . Men creep , Not walk ; with blood too pale and tame To pay the debt they owe to shame ; Buy cheap , sell dear ; eat , drink , and sleep Down-pillowed , deaf to moaning want ; Pay tithes for soul-insurance ; keep Six days to Mammon , one to Cant . In such a time , give thanks to God , That somewhat of the holy rage With which the prophets in their age On all its decent seemings trod , Has set your feet upon the lie , That man and ox and soul and clod Are market stock to sell and buy ! The hot words from your lips , my own , To caution trained , might not repeat ; But if some tares among the wheat Of generous thought and deed were sown , No common wrong provoked your zeal ; The silken gauntlet that is thrown In such a quarrel rings like steel . The brave old strife the fathers saw For Freedom calls for men again Like those who battled not in vain For England 's Charter , Alfred 's law ; And right of speech and trial just Wage in your name their ancient war With venal courts and perjured trust .</p>

    <docDate>God 's ways seem dark , but , soon or late , They touch the shining hills of day ; The evil cannot brook delay , The good can well afford to wait . Give ermined knaves their hour of crime ; Ye have the future grand and great , The safe appeal of Truth to Time !<date>1855</date>. THE KANSAS EMIGRANTS . This poem and the three following were called out by the popular movement of Free State men to occupy the territory of Kansas , and by the use of the great democratic weapon — an over-powering majority — to settle the conflict on that ground between Freedom and Slavery . The opponents of the movement used another kind of weapon . WE cross the prairie as of old The pilgrims crossed the sea , To make the West , as they the East , The homestead of the free ! We go to rear a wall of men On Freedom 's southern line , And plant beside the cotton-tree The rugged Northern pine ! We 're flowing from our native hills As our free rivers flow ; The blessing of our Mother-land Is on us as we go . We go to plant her common schools , On distant prairie swells , And give the Sabbaths of the wild The music of her bells . Upbearing , like the Ark of old , The Bible in our van , We go to test the truth of God Against the fraud of man . No pause , nor rest , save where the streams That feed the Kansas run , Save where our Pilgrim gonfalon Shall flout the setting sun . We 'll tread the prairie as of old Our fathers sailed the sea , And make the West , as they the East , The homestead of the free !<date>1854</date>. LETTER FROM A MISSIONARY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH SOUTH , IN KANSAS , TO A DISTINGUISHED POLITICIAN .</docDate>
    <docImprint>DOUGLAS MISSION , August ,<date>1854</date>,</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>LAST week — the Lord be praised for all His mercies To His unworthy servant !— I arrived Safe at the Mission , via Westport ; where I tarried over night , to aid in forming A Vigilance Committee , to send back , In shirts of tar , and feather-doublets quilted With forty stripes save one , all Yankee comers , Uncircumcised and Gentile , aliens from The Commonwealth of Israel , who despise The prize of the high calling of the saints , Who plant amidst this heathen wilderness Pure gospel institutions , sanctified By patriarchal use . The meeting opened With prayer , as was most fitting . Half an hour , Or thereaway , I groaned , and strove , and wrestled , As Jacob did at Penuel , till the power Fell on the people , and they cried ‘ Amen ! ’ “ Glory to God ! ” and stamped and clapped their hands ; And the rough river boatmen wiped their eyes ; “ Go it , old hoss ! ” they cried , and cursed the niggers — Fulfilling thus the word of prophecy , “ Cursed be Cannan . ” After prayer , the meeting Chose a committee — good and pious men — A Presbyterian Elder , Baptist deacon , A local preacher , three or four class-leaders , Anxious inquirers , and renewed backsliders , A score in all — to watch the river ferry , ( As they of old did watch the fords of Jordan ,) And cut off all whose Yankee tongues refuse The Shibboleth of the Nebraska bill . And then , in answer to repeated calls , I gave a brief account of what I saw In Washington ; and truly many hearts Rejoiced to know the President , and you And all the Cabinet regularly hear The gospel message of a Sunday morning , Drinking with thirsty souls of the sincere Milk of the Word . Glory ! Amen , and Selah !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Here , at the Mission , all things have gone well The brother who , throughout my absence , acted As overseer , assures me that the crops Never were better . I have lost one negro , A first-rate hand , but obstinate and sullen . He ran away some time last spring , and hid In the river timber . There my Indian converts Found him , and treed and shot him . For the rest , The heathens round about begin to feel The influence of our pious ministrations And works of love ; and some of them already Have purchased negroes , and are settling down As sober Christians ! Bless the Lord for this ! I know it will rejoice you . You , I hear , Are on the eve of visiting<settlement>Chicago</settlement>, To fight with the wild beasts of Ephesus , Long John , and Dutch Free-Soilers . May your arm Be clothed with strength , and on your tongue be found The sweet oil of persuasion . So desires Your brother and co-laborer . Amen ! P. S . All 's lost . Even while I write these lines , The Yankee abolitionists are coming Upon us like a flood — grim , stalwart men , Each face set like a flint of Plymouth Rock Against our institutions — staking out Their farm lots on the wooded Wakarusa , Or squatting by the mellow-bottomed Kansas ; The pioneers of mightier multitudes , The small rain-patter , ere the thunder shower Drowns the dry prairies . Hope from man is not . Oh , for a quiet berth at Washington , Snug naval chaplaincy , or clerkship , where These rumors of free labor and free soil Might never meet me more . Better to be Door-keeper in the White House , than to dwell Amidst these Yankee tents , that , whitening , show On the green prairie like a fleet becalmed . Methinks I hear a voice come up the river From those far bayous , where the alligators Mount guard around the camping filibusters “ Shake off the dust of Kansas .

Go forth and follow The message of our gospel , thither borne Upon the point of Quitman 's bowie-knife , And the persuasive lips of Colt 's revolvers .

BURIAL OF BARBER . Thomas Barber was shot December 6 ,<date>1855</date>, near Lawrence , Kansas . BEAR him , comrades , to his grave ; Never over one more brave Shall the prairie grasses weep , In the ages yet to come , When the millions in our room , What we sow in tears , shall reap . Bear him up the icy hill , With the Kansas , frozen still As his noble heart , below , And the land he came to till With a freeman 's thews and will , And his poor hut roofed with snow . One more look of that dead face , Of his murder 's ghastly trace ! One more kiss , O widowed one Lay your left hands on his brow , Lift your right hands up , and vow That his work shall yet be done . Patience , friends ! The eye of God Every path by Murder trod Watches , lidless , day and night ; And the dead man in his shroud , And his widow weeping loud , And our hearts , are in His sight . Every deadly threat that swells With the roar of gambling hells , Every brutal jest and jeer , Every wicked thought and plan Of the cruel heart of man , Though but whispered , He can hear ! We in suffering , they in crime , Wait the just award of time , Wait the vengeance that is due ; Not in vain a heart shall break , Not a tear for Freedom 's sake Fall unheeded : God is true . While the flag with stars bedecked Threatens where it should protect , And the Law shakes Hands with Crime , What is left us but to wait , Match our patience to our fate , And abide the better time ? Patience , friends ! The human heart Everywhere shall take our part , Everywhere for us shall pray ; On our side are nature 's laws , And God 's life is in the cause That we suffer for to-day . Well to suffer is divine ; Pass the watchword down the line , Pass the countersign : “ Endure . ” Not to him who rashly dares , But to him who nobly bears , Is the victor 's garland sure . Frozen earth to frozen breast , Lay our slain one down to rest ; Lay him down in hope and faith , And above the broken sod , Once again , to Freedom 's God , Pledge ourselves for life or death ,</docImprint>

      <head>WHAT OF THE DAY ?</head>
      <head>Written during the stirring weeks when the great political battle for Freedom under Fremont 's leadership was permitting strong hope of success ,— a hope overshadowed and solemnized by a sense of the magnitude of the barbaric evil , and a forecast of the unscrupulous and desperate use of all its powers in the last and decisive struggle .</head>

       <l n="10">Of sleek oppression kneeling down to pray</l>
       <l n="11">Where the great oriel stains the Sabbath day !</l>
       <l n="12">Let whoso can before such praying-books</l>
       <l n="13">Kneel on his velvet cushion ; I , for one ,</l>
       <l n="14">Would sooner bow , a Parsee , to the sun ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or tend a prayer-wheel in Thibetar brooks ,</l>
       <l n="16">Or beat a drum on Yedo 's temple-floor .</l>
       <l n="17">No falser idol man has bowed before ,</l>
       <l n="18">In Indian groves or islands of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="19">Than that which through the quaint-carved Gothic door</l>
       <l n="20">Looks forth ,— a Church without humanity !</l>
       <l n="21">Patron of pride , and prejudice , and wrong ,—</l>
       <l n="22">The rich man 's charm and fetich of the strong ,</l>
       <l n="23">The Eternal Fulness meted , clipped , and shorn ,</l>
       <l n="24">The seamless robe of equal mercy torn ,</l>
       <l n="25">The dear Christ hidden from His kindred flesh ,</l>
       <l n="26">And , in His poor ones , crucified afresh !</l>
       <l n="27">Better the simple Lama scattering wide ,</l>
       <l n="28">Where sweeps the storm Alechan 's steppes along ,</l>
       <l n="29">His paper horses for the lost to ride ,</l>
       <l n="30">And wearying Buddha with his prayers to make</l>
       <l n="31">The figures living for the traveller 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="32">Than he who hopes with cheap praise to beguile</l>
       <l n="33">The ear of God , dishonoring man the while ;</l>
       <l n="34">Who dreams the pearl gate 's hinges , rusty grown ,</l>
       <l n="35">Are moved by flattery 's oil of tongue alone ;</l>
       <l n="36">That in the scale Eternal Justice bears</l>
       <l n="37">The generous deed weighs less than selfish prayers ,</l>
       <l n="38">And words intoned with graceful unction move</l>
       <l n="39">The Eternal Goodness more than lives of truth and love .</l>
       <l n="40">Alas , the Church ! The reverend head of Jay ,</l>
       <l n="41">Enhaloed with its saintly silvered hair ,</l>
       <l n="42">Adorns no more the places of her prayer ;</l>
       <l n="43">And brave young Tyng , too early called away ,</l>
       <l n="44">Troubles the Haman of her courts no more</l>
       <l n="45">Like the just Hebrew at the Assyrian 's door ;</l>
       <l n="46">And her sweet ritual , beautiful but dead</l>
       <l n="47">As the dry husk from which the grain is shed ,</l>
       <l n="48">And holy hymns from which the life devout</l>
       <l n="49">Of saints and martyrs has wellnigh gone out ,</l>
       <l n="50">Like candles dying in exhausted air ,</l>
       <l n="51">For Sabbath use in measured grists are ground ;</l>
       <l n="52">And , ever while the spiritual mill goes round ,</l>
       <l n="53">Between the upper and the nether stones ,</l>
       <l n="54">Unseen , unheard , the wretched bondman groans ,</l>
       <l n="55">And urges his vain plea , prayer-smothered , anthem-drowned !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="56">O heart of mine , keep patience ! Looking forth ,</l>
       <l n="57">As from the Mount of Vision , I behold ,</l>
       <l n="58">Pure , just , and free , the Church of Christ on earth ;</l>
       <l n="59">The martyr 's dream , the golden age foretold !</l>
       <l n="60">And found , at last , the mystic Graal I see ,</l>
       <l n="61">Brimmed with His blessing , pass from lip to lip</l>
       <l n="62">In sacred pledge of human fellowship ;</l>
       <l n="63">And over all the songs of angels hear ;</l>
       <l n="64">Songs of the love that casteth out all fear ;</l>
       <l n="65">Songs of the Gospel of Humanity !</l>
       <l n="66">Lo ! in the midst , with the same look He wore ,</l>
       <l n="67">Healing and blessing on Genesaret 's shore ,</l>
       <l n="68">Folding together , with the all-tender might</l>
       <l n="69">Of His great love , the dark bands and the white ,</l>
       <l n="70">Stands the Consoler , soothing every pain ,</l>

     <p>TO WILLIAM H. SEWARD .</p>
     <p>On the 12th of January , 1861 , Mr. Seward delivered in the Senate chamber a speech on The State of the Union , in which he urged the paramount duty of preserving the Union , and went as far as it was possible to go , without surrender of principles , in concessions to the Southern party , concluding his argument with these words : “ Having submitted my own opinions on this great crisis , it remains only to say , that I shall cheerfully lend to the government my best support in whatever prudent yet energetic efforts it shall make to preserve the public peace , and to maintain and preserve the Union ; advising , only , that it practise , as far as possible , the utmost moderation , forbearance , and conciliation .</p>
     <p>“ This Union has not yet accomplished what good for mankind was manifestly designed by Him who appoints the seasons and prescribes the duties of states and empires . No ; if it were cast down by faction to-day , it would rise again and re-appear in all its majestic proportions to-morrow . It is the only government that can stand here . Woe ! woe ! to the man that madly lifts his hand against it . It shall continue and endure ; and men , in after times , shall declare that this generation , which saved the Union from such sudden and unlooked-for dangers , surpassed in magnanimity even that one which laid its foundations in the eternal principles of liberty , justice , and humanity . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">STATESMAN , I thank thee ! and , if yet dissent</l>
       <l n="2">Mingles , reluctant , with my large content ,</l>
       <l n="3">I cannot censure what was nobly meant .</l>
       <l n="4">But , while constrained to hold even Union less</l>
       <l n="5">Than Liberty and Truth and Righteousness ,</l>
       <l n="6">I thank thee in the sweet and holy name</l>
       <l n="7">Of peace , for wise calm words that put to shame</l>
       <l n="8">Passion and party . Courage may be shown</l>
       <l n="9">Not in defiance of the wrong alone ;</l>
       <l n="10">He may be bravest who , unweaponed , bears</l>
       <l n="11">The olive branch , and , strong in justice , spares</l>
       <l n="12">The rash wrong-doer , giving widest scope ,</l>
       <l n="13">To Christian charity and generous hope .</l>
       <l n="14">If , without damage to the sacred cause</l>
       <l n="15">Of Freedom and the safeguard of its laws —</l>
       <l n="16">If , without yielding that for which alone</l>
       <l n="17">We prize the Union , thou canst save it now</l>
       <l n="18">From a baptism of blood , upon thy brow</l>
       <l n="19">A wreath whose flowers no earthly soil have known ;</l>
       <l n="20">Woven of the beatitudes , shall rest ,</l>
       <l n="21">And the peacemaker be forever blest !</l>
