     <l n="2">These ever wakeful eyes are closed . They saw</l>
     <l n="3">Such grief , that they could see no more . The heart —</l>
     <l n="4">That quick'ning pulse of nations — could not bear</l>
     <l n="5">Another throb of pain , and could not hear</l>
     <l n="6">Another cry of tortur 'd motherhood .</l>
     <l n="7">Those uncomplaining lips , they sob no more</l>
     <l n="8">The soundless sobs of dark and burning tears ,</l>
     <l n="9">That none have seen ; they smile no more , to breathe</l>
     <l n="10">A mother 's comfort into aching hearts .</l>
     <l n="11">The patriarchal Queen , the monument</l>
     <l n="12">Of touching widowhood , of endless love ,</l>
     <l n="13">And childlike purity — she sleeps . This night</l>
     <l n="14">Is watchful not . The restless hand , that slave</l>
     <l n="15">To duty , to a mastermind , to wisdom</l>
     <l n="16">That fathom 'd history and saw beyond</l>
     <l n="17">The times , lies still in marble whiteness . Love</l>
     <l n="18">So great , so faithful , unforgetting and</l>
     <l n="19">Unselfish — must it sleep ? Or will that veil ,</l>
     <l n="20">That widow 's veil unfold , and spread into</l>
     <l n="21">The dovelike wings , that long were wont to hover</l>
     <l n="22">In anxious care about her world-wide nest ,</l>
     <l n="23">And now will soar and sing , as harpchords sing ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whilst in their upward flight they breast the wind</l>
     <l n="25">Of Destiny . No rest for her , no tomb ,</l>
     <l n="26">Nor ashes ! Light eternal ! Hymns of joy !</l>
     <l n="27">No silence now for her , who , ever silent ,</l>
     <l n="28">Above misfortunes ’ storms and thund'ring billows ,</l>
     <l n="29">Would stand with clear and fearless brow , so calm ,</l>
     <l n="30">That men drew strength from out those dauntless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="31">And quiet from that hotly beating heart ,</l>
     <l n="32">Kept still by stern command and unbent will</l>
     <l n="33">Beneath those tight shut lips . Not ashes , where</l>
     <l n="34">A beacon e'er will burn , a fire , like</l>

     <l n="36">The true , the brave , and for the quailing . No ,</l>
     <l n="37">Not ashes , but a light , that o'er the times</l>
     <l n="38">Will shed a gentle ray , and show the haven ,</l>
     <l n="39">When all the world , stormshaken , rudderless , will pray :</l>
     <l n="40">If but her century would shine again !</l>

     <l n="43">Old age is gentle as an autumn morn ;</l>
     <l n="44">The harvest over , you will put the plough</l>

     <l n="46">The sowing you were wont to do .</l>
     <l n="47">Old age</l>

     <l n="49">White curtains . All is light , but light so mild ,</l>
     <l n="50">So quiet , that it cannot hurt .</l>
     <l n="51">The pangs</l>
     <l n="52">Are hushed , for life is wild no more with strife ,</l>
     <l n="53">Nor breathless uphill work , nor heavy with</l>
     <l n="54">The brewing tempests , which have torn away</l>
     <l n="55">So much , that nothing more remains to fear .</l>
     <l n="56">What once was hope , is gone . You know . You saw</l>
     <l n="57">The worst , and not a sigh is left of all</l>
     <l n="58">The heavy sighs that tore your heart , and not</l>
     <l n="59">A tear of all those tears that burnt your cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="60">And ploughed the furrows into them .</l>
     <l n="61">You see</l>
     <l n="62">How others work again and weep again ,</l>
     <l n="63">And hope and fear . Thy alabaster room</l>
     <l n="64">With marble floor and dainty hangings has</l>
     <l n="65">A look so still , that others wonder why</l>
     <l n="66">They feel it churchlike . All thy life is here ;</l>
     <l n="67">Thy life hath built the vault and paved it , and</l>
     <l n="68">Thy hands have woven yonder curtains that</l>
     <l n="69">Surround thy seat , a shady sunshine .</l>
     <l n="70">Age</l>
     <l n="71">Is feeble not to thee , as all thy wishes</l>
     <l n="72">Are silent and demand no effort . Age</l>
     <l n="73">Is kind to thee , allows thee all the rest</l>
     <l n="74">That never came , when life was hard and toilsome .</l>
     <l n="75">Receive it with a smile and clothe thyself</l>
     <l n="76">In white , in Nature 's silver crown , and sing</l>
     <l n="77">A lullaby of promise and of comfort .</l>
     <l n="78">Tell them that life is precious , after work ,</l>
     <l n="79">And after grief and after all the deaths ,</l>
     <l n="80">And not a loathsome burden of a life .</l>
     <l n="81">Old age is like a room of alabaster ,</l>

     <l n="85">Thy soul grows silent , when its accents are</l>

     <l n="87">Has deeply covered it . Thy soul is proud .</l>

     <l n="93">But wounds and burning pain .</l>
     <l n="94">Mysterious is</l>

     <l n="109">To action , to be called by us our own</l>
     <l n="110">Free will . And when we feel alleviated</l>
     <l n="111">Of suffering , we call it hope . In each</l>
     <l n="112">Hard battle of our life , free will is quite</l>
     <l n="113">The same , unbending and undone , and gave</l>
     <l n="114">Us never yet a ray of satisfaction ,</l>
     <l n="115">Nor of real joy , the bleeding conqueror .</l>
     <l n="116">And hope is e'er the same . It dwelleth not</l>
     <l n="117">In hearts that are too great for hope , too great</l>
     <l n="118">For wishes , and that fearless never ask</l>
     <l n="119">Why will is but obedience , power worthless ,</l>
     <l n="120">The greatest strength a reed , and thought an echo .</l>
     <l n="121">Great hearts are free of either want or wish ;</l>

     <l n="126">The crown was laid upon the head that had</l>
     <l n="127">To bear and to exalt it — on the King 's ,</l>
     <l n="128">And then upon the shoulder of the Queen .</l>
     <l n="129">The shoulder bears the weight , the head the burden ;</l>
     <l n="130">The shoulder lifts , the head must carry . Great</l>
     <l n="131">For both the heaviness , the endless pain ,</l>
     <l n="132">For both the thorns , for both hard labour , thankless</l>
     <l n="133">Unending work , the sorrow of their people ,</l>
     <l n="134">The care of each and all , the scorching tears</l>
     <l n="135">Of all , that make their path a desert , and</l>
     <l n="136">Their robe so heavy , as if dew had changed</l>
     <l n="137">Into the icy hangings of the frost .</l>

     <l n="144">Her shoulder bleedeth not , her toil is easy ,</l>
     <l n="145">The load they put upon her without asking</l>
     <l n="146">How great her strength , is like a toy . Oh , smile !</l>

     <l n="148">Escape your loving hearts , and no complaint</l>
     <l n="149">Break from the lips God made to heal and bless !</l>
     <l n="150">Oh , smile ! The world doth not forgive its slaves</l>

     <l n="181">Through unknown land and never-ending work</l>
     <l n="182">Unto Eternity 's great , unknown sea .</l>

     <l n="15">As thine has done . Why ask and why despair ?</l>
     <l n="16">Why not be happy with the sun , the dew ,</l>
     <l n="17">The other flowery hearts that , full of life</l>
     <l n="18">Unfold their petals , which are deep like thine ,</l>
     <l n="19">And rich as thine ? Ye are to be a glorious</l>

     <l n="22">To take away the light and dew , that fall</l>
     <l n="23">Not to your share ? Behold the scythe ! And sow</l>
     <l n="24">Thy seed and ask not where it falls . The wind</l>
     <l n="25">Of fate has carried it away , to place</l>
     <l n="26">Another sentinel , as unknown , as</l>
     <l n="27">Unsought for as thyself , in a far land ,</l>
     <l n="28">To live when thou art gone , to bloom into</l>
     <l n="29">Some unexpected beauty with thy strength ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thy blood , the thoughts that were companions once</l>
     <l n="31">To thee and that the wind hath blown so far</l>
     <l n="32">Away . Thou shalt not say unto thy seed :</l>
     <l n="33">“ Fly thither ! ” It obeyeth not thy will .</l>
     <l n="34">Thou shalt not long to be another plant ;</l>
     <l n="35">Thy tragedy is useless , and thy will</l>
     <l n="36">Is nought . With all thy strength thou art but what</l>
     <l n="37">Is wanted — tree or grassblade — never ask</l>
     <l n="38">Wherefore ? Here is no answer . Fate itself</l>
     <l n="39">Knows not wherefore it blows , or tells thee not ,</l>
     <l n="40">But takes thy noblest self to other climes</l>
     <l n="41">And leaves thee to the scythe . Complain not ! Mourn not !</l>
     <l n="42">Long not to live another day , when thou</l>
     <l n="43">Art called , but bow thy head without a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="44">In gentle acquiescence , sentinel !</l>

     <l n="4">Yet not enough to be forgiving , when</l>
     <l n="5">The sun was pale , and darkness lonely , when</l>
     <l n="6">The fear of unknown evil made thy lips</l>
     <l n="7">Turn cold , and wonder changed to horror , then</l>
     <l n="8">To dumb despair , to childhood 's hopelessness ,</l>
     <l n="9">More hopeless than old age 's iron clutch</l>
     <l n="10">Of unbelief , the shadow of the past</l>

     <l n="12">Go down , Remembrance , into Lethe , go !</l>

     <l n="21">A sham — then say : Go down to Lethe , Thought ,</l>
     <l n="22">And darken not the hour when I rise</l>
     <l n="23">Out of myself , out of the past , into</l>
     <l n="24">The open day of wide forgetfulness .</l>
     <l n="25">When shame has crept into the rocky strength ,</l>
     <l n="26">Into the pure recess a spotless soul</l>
     <l n="27">Had lent thee , and with fiery coals has burnt</l>
     <l n="28">A mark no rivers wash away , no winds</l>
     <l n="29">Can cool , that sends a shudder through thy heart ,</l>
     <l n="30">Like snakes of cold disgust , then say again :</l>
     <l n="31">Go down to Lethe , not to rise and sting .</l>
     <l n="32">But when those eyes , that were thy sun , are shut ,</l>
     <l n="33">When blind with tears thy gaze hath yet behold</l>
     <l n="34">The angel wings that carried through unknown</l>
     <l n="35">Untold of space thy life , thy heart , thy hope —</l>
     <l n="36">No Lethe then ! And no forgetfulness !</l>
     <l n="37">But open wide thy soul : It is the sun ,</l>
     <l n="38">The sun that sends its beauteous rays into</l>
     <l n="39">The dark , into the cold , into the night</l>
     <l n="40">And terror of thy life . If grief hath ploughed</l>
     <l n="41">The soil , fear not ! The corn is rising , young</l>
     <l n="42">And green and full of hope ; the sun hath called ;</l>
     <l n="43">The sun shines full into that heart that was</l>
     <l n="44">So torn , so weak , that could not lift itself</l>
     <l n="45">Unto the heavens . They are open now ,</l>
     <l n="46">Flooded with light ; take not thine eyes away ,</l>
     <l n="47">Bend not thy look unto the earth again ,</l>
     <l n="48">But rise on shining wings toward the rays</l>
     <l n="49">That draw thee , call thee , bear thee to the light !</l>

     <l n="9">And full of childish mirth . Close to the temples</l>
     <l n="10">The hair clings straight and dull and colourless .</l>
     <l n="11">And it was golden once , like living rays ,</l>
     <l n="12">And waved about the head , a sunrise-halo !</l>
     <l n="13">The hands are folded — rigid , waxen , cold ,</l>
     <l n="14">They that were once like rose-leaves , in whose veins</l>
     <l n="15">The blood coursed swiftly , full of generous warmth</l>
     <l n="16">And loving gifts , and flowers , and balm for sorrow .</l>
     <l n="17">Cold are they now , as had they never yet</l>
     <l n="18">Clasped children to the heart , nor with deft touch</l>
     <l n="19">Broidered such fairy work , nor scattered broadcast</l>
     <l n="20">Such fairy gifts . The feet that danced along ,</l>
     <l n="21">Leaving no trace upon the flower-petals ,</l>
     <l n="22">Lie stiff out-stretched , and round about them hang</l>
     <l n="23">In heavy folds , as were they carved in marble ,</l>
     <l n="24">The robes that fluttered lightly in the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="25">Like opalescent wings .</l>
     <l n="26">Ah ! cold and dark</l>
     <l n="27">The grave to thee , thou Sun-child ! ray of brightness !</l>
     <l n="28">Beloved messenger of God ! Arise !</l>
     <l n="29">Canst thou be dead ? and canst thou look so stern ?</l>
     <l n="30">Ah , no ! not stern , but martyred ! Cruel hands</l>
     <l n="31">Have rent thy garments , dragged thee by the hair ,</l>
     <l n="32">Burnt out thine eyes , and filled thy cup with poison ,</l>
     <l n="33">As fit requital of thy priceless gifts ,</l>
     <l n="34">Kind Joy , true friend ! And now they see thee dead</l>
     <l n="35">With careless eyes , and point , and feign to think</l>
     <l n="36">Thou ne'er hast been ! Ah , Joy ! sweet Joy ! arise !</l>
     <l n="37">Be stronger than thy foes ! But no ! ‘ tis vain !</l>
     <l n="38">Poor Joy was deadly tired , and now she sleeps !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Whitewashed or panelled , filled with books , with light ,</l>
     <l n="3">With flowers , with trifles sacred to the heart ,</l>
     <l n="4">And work so pure and sweet that morning-dew</l>
     <l n="5">Might settle there and feel itself at home</l>
     <l n="6">As though ‘ mid garden fragrance ; while the carol</l>
     <l n="7">Of birds streams through the window joyously ,</l>
     <l n="8">Mistaking that abode of peace and love</l>
     <l n="9">For their own woodland haunts ! And in that room</l>
     <l n="10">A woman 's dainty hands ever at work ,</l>
     <l n="11">A woman 's loving heart ever awake</l>
     <l n="12">For others ’ happiness , a woman 's thought</l>
     <l n="13">Alive in tender memories that embalm</l>
     <l n="14">The past in mute forgiveness . Enter then</l>
     <l n="15">As ‘ twere a sanctuary , lay aside</l>
     <l n="16">Thy load of care , and yield thy weary soul</l>
     <l n="17">To the deep sense of comfort reigning there .</l>
     <l n="18">Not many words — nay , not a single word —</l>
     <l n="19">Need tremble through the stillness , not a sigh</l>
     <l n="20">With untoward avowal break the peace</l>
     <l n="21">That folds thee to its heart and asks no question .</l>
     <l n="22">Such perfect peace pervades a room like this ,</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Twould seem the raging storm , the roaring sea ,</l>
     <l n="24">Might lay themselves to rest upon its threshold .</l>
     <l n="25">The ghosts that haunt it come in guise of angels ,</l>
     <l n="26">With rosy finger-tips laid on their lips ,</l>
     <l n="27">To hush our voices to the whispered tones</l>
     <l n="28">Of children 's prayers . Enter , thou weary wanderer ,</l>
     <l n="29">Enter ! and have no fear , for pain and anguish</l>
     <l n="30">Have long been wept away , and have but left</l>
     <l n="31">Their precious perfume and the healing balm</l>
     <l n="32">Of self-forgetfulness to comfort thee !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">To toss with fevered brain and throbbing pulses</l>
     <l n="3">Upon thy bed at night — thine aching eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Straining into the darkness , hot and weary ,</l>
     <l n="5">Thy heart like lead , yet ever wildly bounding</l>
     <l n="6">Within thee , like a gun made loose in shipwreck ,</l>
     <l n="7">That rolls from side to side , an unchained danger ,</l>
     <l n="8">Thy pillows fire , thy couch a rack , whereon</l>
     <l n="9">Thy tortured limbs seem cords strung by the storm ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thy thoughts a tangled skein , unclear , disordered ,</l>
     <l n="11">And all the past that should have been forgotten</l>
     <l n="12">Rising up ghostly , in fantastic guise ,</l>
     <l n="13">To make the present worse , to slay all hope ,</l>
     <l n="14">To quench the beacon that till now has been</l>
     <l n="15">Thy only stay in night 's deep gloom and horror !</l>
     <l n="16">This , O my soul ! is Unrest , and thou knowest</l>
     <l n="17">Its misery but too well ! All the old scars</l>
     <l n="18">Of former battles bleed once more within thee ,</l>
     <l n="19">As if thy life were oozing , drop by drop .</l>
     <l n="20">And thou wert fain with trembling fingers seize</l>
     <l n="21">That foolish heart , and fling it in thy path</l>
     <l n="22">To trample under foot , or , further still ,</l>
     <l n="23">Sink it in sea-depths , and then turn away</l>
     <l n="24">Calm and indifferent , deeming all were well</l>
     <l n="25">Were but its restlessness thus stilled , and thou</l>
     <l n="26">Free from its tumult .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet that heart of thine</l>
     <l n="28">Has weathered may a gale , and still might stand</l>
     <l n="29">Unshaken at the helm of life 's wrecked craft ,</l>
     <l n="30">A gallant pilot , waiting for the sign</l>
     <l n="31">That bids the clouds disperse , hushes the winds ,</l>
     <l n="32">And , having calmed the waves , shall guide thy course</l>
     <l n="33">To sun-lit shores , sweet with immortal flowers .</l>
     <l n="34">Be brave , poor heart , for thou drawest near the haven ,</l>
     <l n="35">And though thy beacon be extinguished , though</l>
     <l n="36">Thy rudder has been snapped , thy compass lost ,</l>
     <l n="37">Thou still art safe , for the same Mighty Hand</l>
     <l n="38">That sent thee forth upon the stormy sea</l>
     <l n="39">Shall lead thee home and give thee rest at last !</l>
