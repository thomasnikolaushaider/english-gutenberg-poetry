     <l n="2">When Ixion from heaven was hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="3">To hell , to be for ever whirl 'd</l>
     <l n="4">In a perpetual damning wheel ,</l>
     <l n="5">The pit 's eternal pains to feel ;</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Twas for a bestial , vulgar deed ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whereby that mortal did succeed</l>
     <l n="8">In sinking Juno to the sod —</l>
     <l n="9">Seducing e'en that beaut'ous god !</l>
     <l n="10">Abomination foul , was this ,</l>
     <l n="11">To ruin lovely Juno 's bliss !—</l>
     <l n="12">To raise in heaven domestic strife ,</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Twixt Jupiter and his lov 'd wife !—</l>
     <l n="14">With sins that never were forgiven ,</l>
     <l n="15">To scandalize the court of heaven !</l>
     <l n="16">When Jupiter in pity took</l>
     <l n="17">This wretch to heaven , on earth forsook ,</l>
     <l n="18">He was a vile contempt'ous thing ,</l>
     <l n="19">Despised by peasant , prince and king ;</l>
     <l n="20">A wand'ring vagrant , shun 'd and curst ,</l>
     <l n="21">For sending AEneus to the dust .</l>
     <l n="22">The aged father of his wife ,</l>
     <l n="23">Base Ixion deprived of life !</l>
     <l n="24">Into a pit of burning fire</l>
     <l n="25">He cast poor AEneus to expire !—</l>
     <l n="26">And , while this cruel , murd'rous knave ,</l>
     <l n="27">For sending AEneus to his grave ,</l>
     <l n="28">From every circle under heaven</l>
     <l n="29">With scorn contemptuous , was driven ,</l>
     <l n="30">This wretched outcast , here forsaken ,</l>
     <l n="31">By Jupiter , was kindly taken</l>
     <l n="32">Into the realms above the skies ,</l>
     <l n="33">And introduced to deities !</l>
     <l n="34">E'en at the tables of the gods</l>
     <l n="35">He set this scoundrel of the clods !</l>
     <l n="36">Such heavenly condescension should</l>
     <l n="37">Inspire a mortal 's gratitude :</l>
     <l n="38">In Ixion 's base and blacken 'd breast</l>
     <l n="39">Some thankfulness should even rest .</l>
     <l n="40">His heart , though steep 'd in every deed</l>
     <l n="41">Of darkness , in the devil 's creed —</l>
     <l n="42">In every sin that stains the earth ,</l>
     <l n="43">Or blackens hell , which gave it birth ,</l>
     <l n="44">Should now have felt a kindly glow</l>
     <l n="45">For what great Jupiter did do .</l>
     <l n="46">But Ixion did only feel</l>
     <l n="47">A base desire at once to steal</l>
     <l n="48">The heart of Juno , and to tread</l>
     <l n="49">On Jupiter 's celestial bed !</l>
     <l n="50">He had an intrigue with the cloud</l>
     <l n="51">Of Juno , which the gods allow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="52">And thus the monstrous Centaur came</l>
     <l n="53">From Ixion 's and Juno 's shame .</l>
     <l n="54">But Jupiter with thunder hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="55">The villain from the heavenly world ,—</l>
     <l n="56">Sent him to hell fore'er to feel</l>
     <l n="57">The ceaseless torments of the wheel .</l>
     <l n="58">But his vile offspring stays behind ,</l>
     <l n="59">The bane and curse of human kind ,—</l>
     <l n="60">Possessing still the bestial fire ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which deep disgraced and damn 'd the sire :</l>
     <l n="62">The same inglorious meanness strays</l>
     <l n="63">In the vile veins and verse and lays</l>
     <l n="64">Of him , on crutches , devil half ,</l>
     <l n="65">( At whom his kindred centaurs laugh ,)</l>
     <l n="66">In that deformity of hell .</l>
     <l n="67">On whom its attributes have fell ,</l>
     <l n="68">In him , whose shameless , wicked life</l>
     <l n="69">Is with abomination rife ,</l>
     <l n="70">Whose works , thrice damn 'd and doubly dead ,</l>
     <l n="71">The produce of conceit and lead ,</l>
     <l n="72">Possess no other aim nor end</l>
     <l n="73">But foul abuse of foe and friend .</l>
     <l n="74">His heart , polluted with the dung</l>
     <l n="75">Of demons damn 'd , from hell out flung ,</l>
     <l n="76">Is rotten to the core with lies ,</l>
     <l n="77">From which foul slanders thickly rise .</l>
     <l n="78">His soul , most pitiful and mean ,</l>
     <l n="79">Infected with hell-scorch 'd gangrene ,</l>
     <l n="80">No kind , redeeming trait contains ,</l>
     <l n="81">But reeks with bestial blots and stains .</l>
     <l n="82">His mind , with vulgar vice imbued ,</l>
     <l n="83">Libidinous and low and lewd ,</l>
     <l n="84">Deep stained with malice , hate and spleen ,</l>
     <l n="85">With sentiments supremely mean ,</l>
     <l n="86">Is bent on mischief , foul as hell ,</l>
     <l n="87">O'er which the hideous Centaurs yell .</l>
     <l n="88">Low was his birth and low his name ,</l>
     <l n="89">Low is his life , and low his fame ;</l>
     <l n="90">But lower still the depths of wo ,</l>
     <l n="91">Where Park , when dead and damn 'd , must go .</l>
     <l n="92">Friends , foes or fiends , alike he fights ,</l>
     <l n="93">In all he says , or sings , or writes .</l>
     <l n="94">This foul defamer , crawling round</l>
     <l n="95">The brink of hell , to catch its sound ,</l>
     <l n="96">Exsudes it thence , in doleful rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="97">Debased and reeking rank with crime .</l>
     <l n="98">On this deformity of man ,</l>
     <l n="99">More monstrous than the bastard Pan ,</l>
     <l n="100">Pegasus turn 'd his nimble feet ,</l>
     <l n="101">As Park , on crutches , crawl 'd the street ;</l>
     <l n="102">Urging that steed , against his will ,</l>
     <l n="103">To bear him up Helicon 's hill .</l>
     <l n="104">But Pegasus , a knowing horse ,</l>
     <l n="105">Perceived that Park 's conceited verse</l>
     <l n="106">Was only suited to the stews</l>
     <l n="107">Of hell , whence emanates his muse .</l>
     <l n="108">He , therefore , with Bellerophon ,</l>
     <l n="109">Left him behind , well trampled on ,</l>
     <l n="110">To tune a pilfer 'd , broken lyre ,</l>
     <l n="111">In fields of mud , and muck , and mire ;</l>
     <l n="112">And there , his song most lowly set ,</l>
     <l n="113">Winding through marshes , undulcet ,</l>
     <l n="114">Contending always with the fog ,</l>
     <l n="115">Unable e'er to flee the bog ,</l>
     <l n="116">Does charm , perhaps , the frogs and snakes ,</l>
     <l n="117">And loathsome reptiles of the lakes .</l>
     <l n="118">Although some demon 's wand'ring sprite</l>
     <l n="119">May , haply , listen with delight ,</l>
     <l n="120">To Park 's low , grov'ling , growling song ,</l>
     <l n="121">As , through the sloughs , it pours along ;</l>
     <l n="122">And though in marshes , fens and ditches ,</l>
     <l n="123">It may , perhaps , amuse the witches ;</l>
     <l n="124">Yet , should an unsuspecting team</l>
     <l n="125">Hear , unawares , the dismal scream</l>
     <l n="126">Of his lugubr'ous , muck-born verse ,</l>
     <l n="127">‘ Twould sadly frighten every horse .</l>
     <l n="128">And , had the Children in the Wood</l>
     <l n="129">Just heard his strain , and understood</l>
     <l n="130">Its wretched , wrangling , dismal din ,</l>
     <l n="131">How frighten 'd had those children been !—</l>
     <l n="132">Believing soon that doom would crack ,</l>
     <l n="133">Or that the de'il was on their track !</l>
     <l n="134">Had Robert Kid , that pirate knave ,</l>
     <l n="135">Heard it come creaking o'er the wave ,</l>
     <l n="136">He had supposed some demon 's shell</l>
     <l n="137">Was sounding from the gates of hell .</l>
     <l n="138">The red men , savage , wild and rude ,</l>
     <l n="139">Deep buried in their solitude ,</l>
     <l n="140">Would wake affrighted from their dreams ,</l>
     <l n="141">If , haply , Park 's poetic screams</l>
     <l n="142">Should penetrate their secret lair ;</l>
     <l n="143">And they , forthwith , would kneel in prayer</l>
     <l n="144">To the great Spirit of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="145">Believing that their days were done ;</l>
     <l n="146">That hell 's dark hole was open thrown ,</l>
     <l n="147">And that this strain was Satan 's own ,</l>
     <l n="148">In wrath , now prowling through the wood ,</l>
     <l n="149">Devouring Indians for his food .</l>
     <l n="150">Ev'n David Crockett would have run ,</l>
     <l n="151">Affrighted , from his game and gun ,</l>
     <l n="152">Had he but heard , in woods remote ,</l>
     <l n="153">Park 's incongruous jangling note ,</l>
     <l n="154">Wild screeching on the western gale ,</l>
     <l n="155">An unpoetic dismal wail :</l>
     <l n="156">Nor stopp 'd in his despairing flight ,</l>
     <l n="157">In San Jacinto , e'en , to fight ;</l>
     <l n="158">But , rushing wildly and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="159">E'en to the billows , off Cape Horn ,</l>
     <l n="160">Most likely there , himself had drown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="161">In terror of the doleful sound .</l>
     <l n="162">In western wilds , had Daniel Boon</l>
     <l n="163">But heard , for once , the lecherous loon ,</l>
     <l n="164">He would have dropp 'd his axe and gun ,</l>
     <l n="165">And , to the eastward , rapid run ;</l>
     <l n="166">Nor stay 'd , in all his fearful flight ,</l>
     <l n="167">For wind or storm , through day and night ,</l>
     <l n="168">Till he some civil spot could reach ,</l>
     <l n="169">Uncursed by Park 's dolorous screech .</l>
     <l n="170">And had Columbus heard his roar ,</l>
     <l n="171">When first he landed on this shore ,</l>
     <l n="172">He would have turn 'd his bark amain ,</l>
     <l n="173">And never ventured here again ;</l>
     <l n="174">Impress 'd that , in this western world ,</l>
     <l n="175">There was , from Pandemonium hurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="176">Some spirit damn 'd for e'er to bark</l>
     <l n="177">The hideous songs of hideous Park .—</l>
     <l n="178">The owls and bats that curse the land ,</l>
     <l n="179">Could they but hear and understand</l>
     <l n="180">The wretched rhymes and nauseous stuff</l>
     <l n="181">Of this conceited , vile ruff-skuff ,</l>
     <l n="182">Would , surely , leave their secret haunts ,</l>
     <l n="183">And ever cease their nightly chants ;</l>
     <l n="184">Convinced that they have been , at last ,</l>
     <l n="185">In frightful strains , by Park surpast ;</l>
     <l n="186">And that this vagrant of the muse ,</l>
     <l n="187">Foul caterer for sinks and stews ,—</l>
     <l n="188">The Five-Points ’ poet , has outdone</l>
     <l n="189">All they have ever screech 'd or sung .</l>
     <l n="190">Despairing , thence , they would retire</l>
     <l n="191">Long distance from his loathsome lyre ,</l>
     <l n="192">And let their lonely caves and rocks</l>
     <l n="193">Resound with his poetic shocks ;</l>
     <l n="194">To be , perhaps , all rent in twain</l>
     <l n="195">By his unearthly , rumbling strain .</l>
     <l n="196">As I was musing on this theme ,</l>
     <l n="197">I fell asleep , and had a dream :</l>
     <l n="198">I saw the fish that skim the deep ,</l>
     <l n="199">And o'er the billows nimbly leap ,</l>
     <l n="200">All sink beneath the boiling wave ,</l>
     <l n="201">Down to the lowest depths , to lave :</l>
     <l n="202">For they had heard the dismal lay</l>
     <l n="203">Of Park come booming down the bay ,</l>
     <l n="204">And , doubtless , thought some hungry shark</l>
     <l n="205">Was chasing them with hellish bark ;</l>
     <l n="206">That his sharp teeth , already nigh ,</l>
     <l n="207">Would them destroy , and they must die ;</l>
     <l n="208">That there , alas , was no escape</l>
     <l n="209">From his terrific gab and gape ,</l>
     <l n="210">And that their gamb'ling , watery run</l>
     <l n="211">Was , now , alas , for ever done !</l>
     <l n="212">And as they , deep in ocean 's ink ,</l>
     <l n="213">Despairing , to the bottom sink ,</l>
     <l n="214">O'erwhelm ' d by that infernal sound ,</l>
     <l n="215">They cast a gloomy gaze around ,</l>
     <l n="216">And call 'd on Neptune , sea-throned god ,</l>
     <l n="217">To smite the rascal with his rod —</l>
     <l n="218">To pierce him with his trident spear ,</l>
     <l n="219">And pitch him into hell to sear ,</l>
     <l n="220">To stew , and fry , in Satan 's dish ,</l>
     <l n="221">For frightening thus , poor harmless fish .</l>
     <l n="222">But Neptune , monarch of the main ,</l>
     <l n="223">With scorn contempt'ous and disdain ,</l>
     <l n="224">Look 'd down on Park 's lugubrious rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="225">And hasten 'd o'er the boiling brine ;</l>
     <l n="226">Unheedful of the fishes ’ cry —</l>
     <l n="227">And left them , with Park 's songs , to die !</l>
     <l n="228">His foaming horses now he lash 'd ,</l>
     <l n="229">Which , through the boisterous billows , dash 'd ;</l>
     <l n="230">Affrighted at the dismal strain ,</l>
     <l n="231">Now wildly screeching o'er the main .</l>
     <l n="232">The god of ocean 's angry wave ,</l>
     <l n="233">Desirous , only , now , to save</l>
     <l n="234">Himself from that unearthly screech ,</l>
     <l n="235">Flew , swift , with might and main , to reach</l>
     <l n="236">The portals of the heavenly world ,</l>
     <l n="237">Whence Ixion , disgraced , was hurl 'd ;</l>
     <l n="238">And there , to gods assembled , tell</l>
     <l n="239">What lately , in the sea , befell</l>
     <l n="240">The finny tribes , that swim the deep ,</l>
     <l n="241">Now sunk , perhaps , in endless sleep !</l>
     <l n="242">The hosts of heaven , when Neptune came ,</l>
     <l n="243">With foaming horses , from the main ,</l>
     <l n="244">Rejoiced to see the briny king ,</l>
     <l n="245">The golden gates , wide open , fling ;</l>
     <l n="246">And , anxiously , all beg to know</l>
     <l n="247">The tidings from the world below ?</l>
     <l n="248">Great Neptune , their celestial guest ,</l>
     <l n="249">With haste , thus answer'ed their request :</l>
     <l n="250">“ O Jove , high heaven 's majestic king ,</l>
     <l n="251">To whom all gods due homage bring : ”</l>
     <l n="252">( And now the monarch of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="253">With awful reverence , bows the knee ) ,</l>
     <l n="254">“ I come in haste , and wish to tell</l>
     <l n="255">How an infernal fiend from hell ,—</l>
     <l n="256">An Ixion spawn ,— kick 'd down from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="257">And through the earth , a vagrant , driven ,</l>
     <l n="258">A cast-off lyre , hath stol'n or begg 'd ,</l>
     <l n="259">Which he , with hempen strings , hath rigg 'd ;</l>
     <l n="260">And now , the ocean , creeks , and bays ,</l>
     <l n="261">Makes , nightly , hideous , with his lays !</l>
     <l n="262">Last night , as I was going to bed ,</l>
     <l n="263">The villain struck the fish all dead !</l>
     <l n="264">His dismal strain , they can n't abide ,</l>
     <l n="265">It smote their ears , and lo , they died !</l>
     <l n="266">My noble steeds , affrighted , too ,</l>
     <l n="267">Like lightning , through the billows , flew ;</l>
     <l n="268">Nor could , the hellish note , divine ,</l>
     <l n="269">That creak 'd , terrific , o'er the brine ;</l>
     <l n="270">And , even , I , myself , was shock 'd ,</l>
     <l n="271">And from my chariot , nearly knock 'd</l>
     <l n="272">Into the boisterous , boiling sea ,</l>
     <l n="273">By that astounding minstrelsy .</l>
     <l n="274">And , now , by all the gods above ,</l>
     <l n="275">By all that men or angels love ,</l>
     <l n="276">I call for thunderbolts or fire ,</l>
     <l n="277">To dash this scoundrel and his lyre ! ”</l>
     <l n="278">Great Jupiter , with horror struck ,</l>
     <l n="279">In wrath , the heavenly mansion shook ;</l>
     <l n="280">And order 'd Vulcan , quick , to forge</l>
     <l n="281">A thunderbolt , tremendous large ,</l>
     <l n="282">With which he smote the venal ghost ,</l>
     <l n="283">And cast him into hell , to roast !</l>
     <l n="284">Now , aught —— —— ever wrote ,</l>
     <l n="285">Let none but fiends incarnate , quote ;</l>
     <l n="286">For , why should men or angels name</l>
     <l n="287">What only sprites infernal claim ;</l>
     <l n="288">Or , why should men , to darkness , turn ,</l>
     <l n="289">A hell-curs 'd villain 's verse , to learn ;</l>
     <l n="290">Or , in poetic marshes , grope ,</l>
     <l n="291">To save a scoundrel from the rope ;—</l>
     <l n="292">To save from damn 'd oblivion , Park ,</l>
     <l n="293">The vilest hound of hell , to bark ,</l>
     <l n="294">To howl , to scream , and vilify</l>
     <l n="295">The rich , the poor , the low , the high ;</l>
     <l n="296">Who pours on virtue 's hallow 'd leaf</l>
     <l n="297">The vile pollutions of a thief ;</l>
     <l n="298">Who age , nor youth , nor beauty spares ;</l>
     <l n="299">But , vulture-like , voracious , tears</l>
     <l n="300">The guileless maid and spotless heart ,</l>
     <l n="301">And stabs them with his venom 'd dart !</l>
     <l n="302">Let Satan bind , with chains of fire ,</l>
     <l n="303">This vain , conceited , bestial liar ;</l>
     <l n="304">Whom gods , and men , and angels spurn ,</l>
     <l n="305">And call on hell his soul to burn !</l>
