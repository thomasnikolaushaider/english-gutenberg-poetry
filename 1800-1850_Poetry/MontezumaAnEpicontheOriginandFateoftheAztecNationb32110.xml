   <p>ARGUMENT OF THE POEM .</p>
   <p>From the moment of my earliest acquaintance with Colonial History , I have felt all the pressure of a task laid upon me , tightening its grasp as I reached maturer years ; that of an attempt to rescue the Aztecs from their letterless and mythical position in history , to the position which their possibilities at least argue for them ; and this feeling has been far less the outgrowth of the enthusiasm awakened for the Aztecs , as the indignation felt at the whole conduct of the Spanish Conquest .</p>
   <p>Realizing the gravity of the task , I have been led to carefully weigh and investigate the different theories advanced as to the origin of the Aztecs , and to adopt the argument of the poem as the best ground on which to unite the Sun Worship of the East with the Mythology of of the West .</p>
   <p>Reverently , and with a full realization of how great must ever be the distance between the actual work and the ideal of my early inspiration , I lay the gathered chaplet at the shrine of old Chapultepec , and only regret that the fruiting should have fallen so far short of the promise of its blooming .</p>
   <p>To Hubert Howe Bancroft the living , and W. H. Prescott the dead , differing as they do in some very material respects , yet essentially the same in spirit , I wish to record my indebtedness for their admirable and exhaustive works that have induced to a final effort the poem of which this is prefatory .</p>
   <p>Some years since , I found in an abridged history of the United States , a brief outline that led me back to the Dispersal at Shinar ( certainly a safe location for a speculative beginning ) for the origin of the Aztec race .</p>
   <p>It occurs to me now , with a shade of the ludicrous , that if safety were the all-important thing in the premises , I might have gone back a step farther to the figs and pomegranites of Eden , and prayed for the shade of Adam to cover the exotic which I have humbly tried to rescue from what seems to me to be an undeserved obscurity . The careful analogies drawn between Egypt and the Aztecs by both Prescott and Bancroft could be better met by locating the origin at Shinar than at any other point , as it takes us back to a date where we may consistently locate the Shepherd Kings and the overrunning of Mizraim by them , a part of Egypt 's early history which is outlined ( more or less briefly ) by nearly all early historians .</p>
   <p>As to the initial period of Sun Worship and its origin , I could of necessity have but little aid , and if I have seemed a little too speculative , I have only this apology : The prodigy of Egypt 's prehistoric development , and the manufacture of glass , antedating historic research . It needs no great imaginative tension to crown some incipient philosopher not only with the discovery of glass , but , that in its proper shape , it could be made to concentrate the solar rays , and produce fire ; and at that day and age , what possible superstitions might result from these discoveries !</p>
   <p>After the re-establishment of the Mizraim descent , and the consequent expulsion of the “ Sons of Lud , ” the line of their journey is the natural outgrowth of their religious fanaticism . They know that India and the far East are inhabited , and they seek the uninhabited track for their exit .</p>
   <p>The Mound Builders seem to be historic cousins of the Aztecs , certainly the superiors of the aborigines of the North and Middle Atlantic .</p>
   <p>The expulsion of the Mound Builders will admit of many theories , and I have simply adopted the one that occurred to me as consistent with the Christian inspiration of all great events .</p>
   <p>The settlement of Mexico by the Aztecs , ( as a branch of the Mound Builders ) follows naturally in the wake of previous events , and the chain is thus made complete , with no serious hazard to its consistency as merely speculative drama , leading up to what is plainly historical .</p>
   <p>I have striven to be historically consistent , following the letter of events closely , taking conjectural ground in but few instances .</p>
   <p>If I have seemed to be censorious , even to rancor at times , I have only given vent to the repressed indignation of Prescott and other authors on the subject of the Spanish Conquest .</p>
   <p>The only possible justification for the excesses of Cortez and his adherents , is the age in which the Conquest took place ; and those who seek to justify it in this way , point to the opening of the present century , and to Napoleon , decoying the imbecile king and the weak Asturias into abdication and banishment to make room for his brother Joseph . This is a plague-mark upon the present century , and though a plain case of retributive justice through the visiting of the sins of the fathers upon the children , still the fact remains that the attempt to bring right of any multiple of wrongs , must always record a failure .</p>
   <p>A sufficient answer to the latitude of the age , is the fact that a corresponding age gave us Plymouth , and not long after Penn 's colony ; nor can the Spaniards claim the same justification for excesses as these coincident colonists , all of whom had felt the lash of religious intolerance . The Spanish Conquest , antedating the divisions that followed the reformation , has no such covert for their lustful excrescences .</p>
   <p>Any system of religious ethics that severs human responsibility from the domain of conscience , and furnishes a market for the indulgences that cover all the excesses of the body politic , cannot be expected to bring forth the best of fruit from a bloom so blighted by human lust , and so blackened by human selfishness .</p>
   <p>If , amid all of their intolerance and deceit , they had respected the homely records and the grotesque landmarks of the nation they destroyed , the cavaliers might have shown them as a slight palliation , and at once furnished the historian the shadow of justification for their abuses ; but the mental caste that could adopt any , and every device of deception and treachery to accomplish its ends , threw itself at once into the arms of a priestcraft , if possible more implacable than themselves ; and obedient to their demands , tore down their landmarks , and ground their records to powder .</p>
   <p>Surely , there is no fanaticism like religious fanaticism , and no licentiousness like that of the unbridled devotee of the Church .</p>
   <p>Finally , as a whole , I feel confident that my effort will not fail to create food for thought , and eventually justify the effort which called it forth . To a nature partially Huguenot in its origin , and more so in sympathy and inclination , I have tried to add the temperate element that would impart freedom from undue prejudice and passion ; but as the work is of necessity vindicatory on the one hand , and repressive on the other , I have been compelled to use good , plain Saxon words in the closing pages , justified only by the verity of their signification .</p>
   <p>The body of the work is given in decimeters , varying in only a few cases where the expression seemed to require a different form .</p>
   <p>I would rather not close these already extended remarks without recording my testimony , with that of others , of the positive pleasure experienced both in the progress and completion of a work of this character ; and if I shall have been as fortunate in securing and retaining an auditory , I shall be twice blessed ; for our highest ambition should ever be that of contributing to the happiness of others .</p>
   <p>The reward of earnest labor , conscientiously performed , is the prize only once exceeded in the economy of things , and that once beyond the ken of our divulgence ; yet , may we not hope that there is no actual severance between the earthly type and the heavenly reality , that the crown honestly won , and the prize worthily gained on earth , may both , retaining their semblance , the more perfectly glow in the clearer atmosphere of heaven .</p>

    <head>THE DISPERSAL AT SHINAR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As mariner upon the rocky sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Without a compass , helm , or heavenly hope ,</l>
     <l n="3">A part of Earth 's great ancestry to be</l>
     <l n="4">Upon the plains of Shinar ; and they grope</l>
     <l n="5">In nature 's darkness ; they have lost the way</l>
     <l n="6">That leadeth to the Father , and can find</l>
     <l n="7">No clue of that great Presence , once their stay ,</l>
     <l n="8">And still as near ; but sin doth make us blind ,</l>
     <l n="9">And when it fastens on the soul , the Father fades away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">How wholly lost , when man cannot descry</l>
     <l n="11">One token of his Maker in the soul —</l>
     <l n="12">One step remains , the animal must die ;</l>
     <l n="13">But death has superseded its control ,</l>
     <l n="14">Since the immortal “ Ego ” is no more ,</l>
     <l n="15">The spirit gone from its companion , dust —</l>
     <l n="16">The ashes are but animate in vain</l>
     <l n="17">When love , and light , have given place to lust</l>
     <l n="18">And conscience gives no puncture for its pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Thus were they gathered , in this day far gone ,</l>
     <l n="20">So near the causeway of the almighty past ,</l>
     <l n="21">That retrospect brings close , the thought of God —</l>
     <l n="22">We wonder that a cloud could overcast ,</l>
     <l n="23">So primitive a people , that the Shepherd 's voice</l>
     <l n="24">Should leave no lingering echo , for the ear , so tokened and so</l>
     <l n="25">choice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">And they would build a city , and a tower</l>
     <l n="27">Whose top would reach the very verge of Heaven ;—</l>
     <l n="28">The puniest arm , is puissent in power ,</l>
     <l n="29">When to its grasp supernal aid is given ;</l>
     <l n="30">But muscles may , like cordage , swell the arm ,</l>
     <l n="31">And arteries , like rills of mountains flow .</l>
     <l n="32">Weak is the blood that breakers them to harm ,—</l>
     <l n="33">The fires of passion but a moment glow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="34">They , as the infants play upon the rim</l>
     <l n="35">Of ancient Ocean , had been rocked to sleep</l>
     <l n="36">In the bare arms of Nature ; she would trim</l>
     <l n="37">Her lamps for them , and patient vigil keep</l>
     <l n="38">Upon their slumbers ; and Heaven , to them ,</l>
     <l n="39">Was but a brilliant , close-spread canopy ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or crystal dome , a sort of diadem</l>
     <l n="41">Just out of easy reach , and they could see</l>
     <l n="42">No reason why they might not build a tower</l>
     <l n="43">Would intercept it ; and their foolish pride</l>
     <l n="44">Supposed this little caprice of the hour ,</l>
     <l n="45">Through all the after age , would witness of their power .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">They made them bricks , and steadily they reared</l>
     <l n="47">The spiral column heavenward ; the Great Eye</l>
     <l n="48">Bent vigilantly on them , as they neared</l>
     <l n="49">The upper ether , silent as the sky</l>
     <l n="50">Draws round its garniture ; into each soul</l>
     <l n="51">Crept the first rootlets of an unknown tongue ;</l>
     <l n="52">Each household head placed under his control</l>
     <l n="53">The elements of intercourse , first flung</l>
     <l n="54">Together by the great Teacher ; just before</l>
     <l n="55">When they had dropped from their exulting hands</l>
     <l n="56">The rough-made tools ; they closed forevermore</l>
     <l n="57">Their mutual labor , though in other lands</l>
     <l n="58">They could resume their use , this was the last</l>
     <l n="59">Of the poor monument that they had reared —</l>
     <l n="60">The workmen stand in wonderment aghast ,</l>
     <l n="61">Though they had wrought together , and had cheered</l>
     <l n="62">Each other in their task , each quivering lip</l>
     <l n="63">Breathed but confusion to the other 's ears ,</l>
     <l n="64">No more from common cup of thought they sip ,</l>
     <l n="65">But forced to strangerhood for many , many years .</l>

     <l n="66">In what a school was fashioned our first thought .</l>

     <l n="69">How are we littled , what a nameless thing</l>

     <l n="71">Thou settest up , and pullest down , and we —</l>

    <head>MIZRAIM AND LUD .</head>
    <head>Near the rim of Karoun , where the pyramids drink the dew that should dampen the soil ; And the Nilus pours over its green level banks , its annual freightage of spoil ; Where the date ripens dark to the child of the sun , and the pomegranate colors for fruit ; The ibis is sounding the damps of the land , and earth in its plethory mute .</head>
     <l n="1">The fat of the fields husks the voice of the morn , while</l>
     <l n="2">Demeter is weighing her sheaves ;</l>
     <l n="3">The lotus has honied its lips for the kiss , “ and the turtle</l>
     <l n="4">in mockery grieves . ”</l>
     <l n="5">What is that , where the Orient gathers her gold , and the eye</l>
     <l n="6">wanders back to the sea ?</l>
     <l n="7">What cloud on the horizon 's breach can be seen ? What wakens</l>
     <l n="8">the vulture 's rude glee ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Tis the shock of the battle that burdens the air , and the armies that burden the eye ; They have met ( could Elysian give landscape more fair ? ) , have met to embrace and to die . The Prophet still lives , and has led to the sun all Egypt ; and gathered as one The people to hallow the harvest-moon feast , ere the work of the year is done .</p>
   <p>But Mizraim outnumbers the children of Lud , and the shepherd kings , crafty and weak , Have laid tasks on their shoulders too heavy to bear , till the voice of their burden must speak . In vain the gray Prophet lifts up to his god his winglet of prayer for peace ; The tempest of war has broke over the plain , and his altars can bring no surcease .</p>
   <p>The black and the bronze , the iron and brass ; how they struggle and grip for the field ! The spear and the arrow , the halbert and lance , and who shall be first to yield ? Not the iron ; it is strong and resistless in weight . Not the brass ; it is beaten and firm . What a hecate of agony burdens the plain ! what a banquet for vulture and worm ! But the iron is too heavy , the brass is too thin , and under the weight it gives way , As a wall , that is breached and toppled by time ; and Mizraim gains the day .</p>

     <l n="199">Gave the unspoken pledge of their return .</l>
     <l n="200">The sun , still coy , refused to climb as high</l>
     <l n="201">As it had done in Egypt ; still they burn</l>
     <l n="202">With new-born hope , as they float down to sea ,</l>
     <l n="203">And , moving counter to their winged friends ,</l>
     <l n="204">Cross to Lopatka , where they only wait</l>
     <l n="205">Replenishment , which nature always sends ,</l>
     <l n="206">Where faith is instinct as in lower life ,</l>
     <l n="207">( The birds teach providence , without a chance ,)</l>
     <l n="208">And so they wander on , to the Aleutes ;</l>
     <l n="209">Passing and calling , as they still advance ,</l>
     <l n="210">They reach to where Alaska strikes the sea ,</l>
     <l n="211">In severance to meet them . They kept on ,</l>
     <l n="212">Feeding on eggs of seabirds , and the meats</l>
     <l n="213">That everywhere supplied them . They have gone</l>
     <l n="214">So far on Nature 's very track , and now</l>
     <l n="215">A narrow river beckons their research ,</l>
     <l n="216">And they pass upward , till a mountain range</l>
     <l n="217">Confronts their passage , like a royal perch</l>
     <l n="218">From which the gods might frown their hardihood ,</l>
     <l n="219">For this intrusion of another world .</l>
     <l n="220">But they have battled with the plague and flood ;</l>
     <l n="221">And though Olympus all his thunders hurled ,</l>
     <l n="222">They had not turned ; they saw the earnest need</l>
     <l n="223">Of pushing forward ere the sun turned back ,</l>
     <l n="224">And so they crossed to where the eastern slope ,</l>
     <l n="225">Feeds the McKenzie . Here an easy track</l>
     <l n="226">Leads down and cuts the stronger range in two ,</l>
     <l n="227">A little while among its shadows grope ,</l>
     <l n="228">When the broad prospect opened to their view .</l>
     <l n="229">They follow the receding sun in hope ,</l>
     <l n="230">Still bearing to the east their steady trend ,</l>
     <l n="231">Hoping to win their God to close embrace ;</l>
     <l n="232">And morn and eve around their altars bend</l>
     <l n="233">In thankfulness , that they still see his face .</l>
     <l n="234">Through many valleys , virgin to their sight ,</l>
     <l n="235">And many lakes , whose bosoms never stirred</l>
     <l n="236">To man , the weak pretender of God 's might ;</l>
     <l n="237">But nature spreads her happy hearth with beast and flower</l>
     <l n="238">and bird .</l>

    <head>THE PROPHET 'S DEATH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Groping in undiscovered realms their way ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Prophet and his people give the day</l>
     <l n="3">To finding safest lodgement , till they press</l>
     <l n="4">Well down the grand old river , to the mouth</l>
     <l n="5">Of the great Western confluent — the south</l>

     <l n="9">And fortune seems to have forgot its frown .</l>
     <l n="10">Years of repletion fill their shattered ranks ,</l>
     <l n="11">And youth and vigor take the place of age ;</l>
     <l n="12">The story of their journey is retold</l>
     <l n="13">By only few in number ; and the sage ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who turned their faces on their god of gold ,</l>
     <l n="15">Was bent with the plethoric weight of years ,</l>
     <l n="16">And summoned them to worship ‘ mid the tears</l>
     <l n="17">Of many , who misgave his failing strength ;</l>

     <l n="23">The shining surface of our god has led</l>
     <l n="24">Our toilsome footsteps ; we must not forget</l>
     <l n="25">His daily nurture , nor the cloth of gold</l>
     <l n="26">With which he covers us — wakeful with the day ,</l>
     <l n="27">How has he touched our eyelids with his hands ,</l>
     <l n="28">And warmed us with his hovering ! The night</l>
     <l n="29">Has never failed his promise of the morn .</l>
     <l n="30">How has his parenthood outwatched the stars ;</l>
     <l n="31">How has the Winter melted at his glance ;</l>
     <l n="32">How has his armor battled with the snows !</l>
     <l n="33">With what a tenderness he decks the fields ,</l>
     <l n="34">And wooes the grasses from the dormant earth ,</l>
     <l n="35">And clothes the forest with its robes of green ,</l>
     <l n="36">As covert for the bison and the deer ,</l>
     <l n="37">That we may find replenishment of food !</l>
     <l n="38">His providence has never failed our steps ,</l>

     <l n="75">Unsanctioned hands to touch them ; and they reared</l>

     <l n="19">So on these nations had been writ , in brief ,</l>
     <l n="20">The deep-burned liturgy of hardened strife ,</l>
     <l n="21">And through the furnace of their pungent grief ,</l>
     <l n="22">They learn to plant the rootlets of their life .</l>
     <l n="23">One thing is never lacking , at the time ,</l>
     <l n="24">When in their nascent passions , nations rise :</l>
     <l n="25">The craft of Priests , in every age and clime ,</l>
     <l n="26">To “ point a moral , ” or portend the skies .</l>
     <l n="27">And so , from cast-off altars to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="28">New pleadings to new conjured gods arose ;</l>
     <l n="29">The selfish passions since the world begun ,</l>
     <l n="30">All seek supernal outlet on their foes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="31">One thing , not far from truth , grew into form :</l>
     <l n="32">The thought of one great , universal heart ,</l>
     <l n="33">That beat against the window pane of thought ,</l>
     <l n="34">And formed of all existences a part .</l>
     <l n="35">How near the passions of mankind will verge ,</l>
     <l n="36">Sometimes , upon the borderland of bliss !</l>
     <l n="37">And all the race is bettered if they urge</l>
     <l n="38">Continuous march ; nor turn their steps amiss ;</l>
     <l n="39">A little light would lead them on to God ,</l>
     <l n="40">And lacking , it the race for ages plod .</l>
     <l n="41">O that the infant eye of every race</l>
     <l n="42">Might recognize at once the Master 's face !</l>
     <l n="43">All brought their tribute to Tonatiuh 's shrine ,</l>
     <l n="44">Still burnishing the sun with rays divine .</l>
     <l n="45">True worship strengthens in the wake of years ;</l>
     <l n="46">Its song grows rhythmal with repeated chant ;</l>
     <l n="47">Its beauty lingers , though it disappears ;</l>
     <l n="48">Rekindle , and it melts the adamant .</l>
     <l n="49">But worship on a purely human base ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though it may work its legends into song</l>
     <l n="51">And deify the noblest of its race ,</l>
     <l n="52">Can never be unquestionably strong .</l>
     <l n="53">The happenings of Nature clog its wheels ;</l>
     <l n="54">The elements brush down its cobweb foils ;</l>
     <l n="55">And from its mimicry the heart appeals ,</l>
     <l n="56">And heavenly souls are not for human toils .</l>
     <l n="57">It is impossible to still the brain</l>
     <l n="58">By merely human fiat at it thrust ;</l>
     <l n="59">Man journeys out , and he returns again —</l>
     <l n="60">The Father 's voice alone can call him from the dust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="61">And yet , each effort of the human soul ,</l>
     <l n="62">To force existence for its latent wings ,</l>
     <l n="63">Is of an energy that leaps control ,</l>
     <l n="64">Whose germ from our immortal nature springs .</l>
     <l n="65">The very latch-key of the eternal realm ,</l>
     <l n="66">Though touched in ignorance , commands the door .</l>
     <l n="67">A more than human wisdom guides the helm ,</l>
     <l n="68">As we approach the palm-extending shore .</l>
     <l n="69">The hungry arms that reach out after God ,</l>
     <l n="70">Are as the infants for the parent 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="71">The soul is weary of its fruitless plod ,</l>
     <l n="72">And Nature beckons it to perfect rest .</l>
     <l n="73">What though the stream be poisoned , if its flow</l>
     <l n="74">Seeks only the great ocean to be lost ;</l>
     <l n="75">Not long upon its bosom is it tossed ,</l>
     <l n="76">Ere it recovers its old healthful glow .</l>
     <l n="77">The old-time sparkle of the mountain spring ,</l>
     <l n="78">Gleams in the dew-drop that returns to earth .</l>
     <l n="79">No poison lurks within the second birth ,</l>
     <l n="80">It ever carries healing on its wing .</l>
     <l n="81">Thus , howsoe'er the soul may find its way ,</l>
     <l n="82">Over the wilderness to Jordan 's plain ,</l>
     <l n="83">It shall not fail of its eternal gain ,</l>
     <l n="84">The night so trackless shall break into day .</l>
     <l n="85">The saint , whom angels ushered through the gate ,</l>
     <l n="86">With paeans of rejoicing , once did grope</l>
     <l n="87">And lose his way , and loose his hold on hope —</l>
     <l n="88">No soul that reaches it is told to wait .</l>
     <l n="89">God waits upon the effort to reply ,</l>
     <l n="90">And seeing human hands stretch out for aid ,</l>
     <l n="91">His stronger palm is soon upon them laid —</l>
     <l n="92">Our weakness is the signet he cannot deny .</l>

    <head>THE TOLTECS JOURNEY SOUTH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Toltecs were the first to break the way</l>
     <l n="2">Toward the vertex of the Summer sun ;</l>
     <l n="3">To catch the fervor of his ripest ray ,</l>
     <l n="4">And talismise the pilgrimage begun .</l>
     <l n="5">And after many days their fasting eyes</l>
     <l n="6">Are feasted with Mexitli 's [ A ] lovely plain —</l>
     <l n="7">So like a newly-fashioned paradise ,</l>
     <l n="8">An almost Eden , sprung to life again .</l>
     <l n="9">Her placid lakes gave back her deep blue sky</l>
     <l n="10">In rivalry of Nature — Nature 's charms</l>
     <l n="11">Do cast reflected multiples , and try</l>
     <l n="12">To fold us in with her unnumbered arms .</l>
     <l n="13">Not all we see , but all we feel , invites ,</l>
     <l n="14">Together with our seeing , to secure</l>
     <l n="15">An unrestricted homage ; all unite</l>
     <l n="16">In this uncovered world , so rich and pure</l>
     <l n="17">And lade with sunshine , ripened into form ,</l>
     <l n="18">Concentered rays to leaves and blossoms grown ,</l>
     <l n="19">The larch impendent with its verdant cone ,</l>
     <l n="20">The oak 's historic battlement of storm ,</l>
     <l n="21">The cypress mourning and exultant palms ,</l>
     <l n="22">The provident maguey , whose offered alms</l>
     <l n="23">Found ready acceptation at their hands ,</l>
     <l n="24">The maize , which they had known in northern lands ,</l>
     <l n="25">Were native to her rich and virgin soil</l>
     <l n="26">And gave the husbandman unstinted spoil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">And thus , with Nature and themselves at rest ,</l>
     <l n="28">Fresh inspiration from the God of peace</l>
     <l n="29">Expands and energizes every breast ,</l>
     <l n="30">And fettered manhood labors for release .</l>
     <l n="31">Invention is emancipation : Time</l>
     <l n="32">Doth loosen Nature 's fetters ; man invents</l>
     <l n="33">Not one of those discoveries sublime</l>
     <l n="34">That couples his poor name with consequence .</l>
     <l n="35">The world had moved a million years or so</l>
     <l n="36">Ere Galileo blundered into prison</l>
     <l n="37">For telling how we are compelled to go .</l>
     <l n="38">The fog of superstition had not risen ;</l>
     <l n="39">And he whose brain peered up above the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="40">To widen the horizon of his thought ,</l>
     <l n="41">Must be content to leave the gnarlish crowd</l>
     <l n="42">Of puppets and of priestcraft who have fought</l>
     <l n="43">The van of progress , immemorial time ,</l>
     <l n="44">In fear some newly loosened truth might break</l>
     <l n="45">Some preconcerted dogma , deeming crime</l>
     <l n="46">The impulsive movement of the soul to slake</l>
     <l n="47">The thirst that God implanted there , to burn</l>
     <l n="48">Its way into the hidden and unseen ,</l>
     <l n="49">And find new thoroughfares for its return ,</l>
     <l n="50">And on creation 's outer verge new entities to glean .</l>
     <l n="51">So did these primal pioneers look out</l>
     <l n="52">Beyond the compass of their husbandry ,</l>
     <l n="53">And challenge their surroundings ; manly , stout ,</l>
     <l n="54">And earnest did they seek the mystic tree</l>
     <l n="55">Of knowledge in this Eden of the West ,</l>
     <l n="56">Not interdicted by Divine decree ,</l>
     <l n="57">But always open to the manly quest</l>
     <l n="58">And the unflagging purpose to be free .</l>
     <l n="59">The zodiac gave up its lettered scroll</l>
     <l n="60">To their inquiries ; and the measured year</l>
     <l n="61">Unsealed the clasp that held it from control ,</l>
     <l n="62">And truths that had seemed very far , revealed themselves</l>
     <l n="63">quite near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="64">Their rudely fashioned lodges soon gave way</l>
     <l n="65">To buildings of a more pretentious form ;</l>
     <l n="66">The forests and the quarries and the clay</l>
     <l n="67">Were forced to human vassalage . The charm</l>
     <l n="68">That held the forest templary from spoil</l>
     <l n="69">Was not entirely broken ; after years</l>
     <l n="70">And Christian conquest must consume the toil</l>
     <l n="71">And travail of the centuries . Our tears ,</l>
     <l n="72">Are but a poor atonement for the brand</l>
     <l n="73">Our westward march has made on Nature 's back .</l>
     <l n="74">We mourn our forest fastnesses too late ;</l>
     <l n="75">With hand unbridled we have torn their face ,</l>
     <l n="76">And given legal sanction to their fate —</l>
     <l n="77">But what companionship can take their place ?</l>
     <l n="78">Nearest to Nature 's very heart of hearts ,</l>
     <l n="79">The verdant monarchs beckon us to God ;</l>
     <l n="80">Their benison with life alone departs ;</l>
     <l n="81">They testify of Eden from the sod .</l>
     <l n="82">O man ! that thy perfection should be lost ,</l>
     <l n="83">When so much perfectness is left on earth !</l>
     <l n="84">How much of bitterness ! With what a cost</l>
     <l n="85">Didst thou forget the sacred touch that hallowed thee</l>
     <l n="86">at birth !</l>

     <l n="90">A god , whom weakness could at once control ;</l>
     <l n="91">A prophecy , of Fatherhood to come ;</l>

     <l n="96">Not all in vain . The white-winged dove of peace</l>

     <l n="115">One lesson may we glean : That evermore</l>
     <l n="116">The souls that move with nature on her march</l>
     <l n="117">Are those who drop , as she drops down her leaves ;</l>
     <l n="118">They fill the earth with fruitfulness , and arch</l>
     <l n="119">The highway of the nations with their sheaves ;</l>
     <l n="120">They sleep to history , but wake to God ;</l>
     <l n="121">Theirs is the pass-key through eternal gates ;</l>
     <l n="122">They write no vengeful Sanscrit on the sod ;</l>
     <l n="123">They linger at no earthly court , but the recording seraph</l>
     <l n="124">waits</l>
     <l n="125">To write them blessed of the Lord , the jewels of the fates .</l>

     <l n="1">The silver current of the upper Grande ,</l>

     <l n="4">New ground from granite that has been released</l>

     <l n="9">Where Coronado laid in after years</l>
     <l n="10">The scepter of his Sovereign , and bespoke</l>

     <l n="24">Yet , in their husbandry , they were the least .</l>

    <head>DEATH OF MONTEZUMA .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">One sad , sad task , awaits my faltering pen ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I have done . One flower upon his grave ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who in his dying could , alas ! not save</l>
     <l n="4">His country from the vulturous maw of men .</l>
     <l n="5">They played upon the monarch with their arts ,</l>
     <l n="6">Till he became a captive in their hands ;</l>

     <l n="8">That their good host should follow their commands .</l>
     <l n="9">They said their Christian lord across the sea</l>
     <l n="10">Must have his treasure for their Christian use .</l>
     <l n="11">All this was bitter , yet , he did agree ,</l>

     <l n="13">They struck their temples , and the red , right hand</l>

     <l n="16">Made tribute to a stranger ; but , beware</l>
     <l n="17">Stern warriors of Castile ! touch not their gods .</l>
     <l n="18">The hearts of Aztlan are but human hearts ,</l>

     <l n="24">It may assist upon the wheels of fate ,</l>
     <l n="25">But what Spain offered through such legatees</l>

     <l n="27">To gather fruit from such ill-freighted trees ,</l>

     <l n="32">And pointed to their Master on the tree .</l>
     <l n="33">Their Master ? No ! since Lucifer was hurled</l>
     <l n="34">Down from the shining chambers of the just</l>

     <l n="39">The people gather at the palace gates ,</l>

     <l n="43">It harbors those who wrote themselves as knaves</l>
     <l n="44">Upon the pliant tablets of their lives ,</l>
     <l n="45">And now the incensed nation only craves</l>
     <l n="46">Deliverance for their children and their wives .</l>
     <l n="47">They know the belching cannon of the knights</l>
     <l n="48">Will make sad havoc in their stately host ;</l>
     <l n="49">They know that Spain and Fate to-day unite ;</l>
     <l n="50">They know , if fortune fails them , all is lost ;</l>
     <l n="51">But they can bear no longer to be torn ,</l>

     <l n="53">The Spaniards see their perfidy , too late ;</l>

     <l n="59">We fight against the gods ? Lay down your arms !</l>
     <l n="60">Go to your homes , and all shall yet be well ,</l>

     <l n="68">A cloud of stones and arrows flew the air ;</l>

     <l n="70">His heart had broke when he beheld the throng ,</l>

     <l n="72">And when the missiles smote his fevered crest ,</l>
     <l n="73">His very soul was reaching out for rest .</l>
     <l n="74">They only helped to roll the burden off ,</l>
     <l n="75">So long imprinted on his saddened face —</l>
     <l n="76">It was too much to hear his people scoff —</l>
     <l n="77">He fell ; and they removed him from the place .</l>
     <l n="78">He never rose again , nor wished to rise ;</l>
     <l n="79">He made no effort to outlive his land ;</l>
     <l n="80">He felt his weakness , and he heard her cries ;</l>
     <l n="81">He saw her sinking with his wasting sand .</l>
     <l n="82">He knew his enemies had stole the garb</l>
     <l n="83">Of gods to fasten on him their deceit ;</l>
     <l n="84">That they had stung the nation with their barb ,</l>
     <l n="85">And he would not survive its sore defeat .</l>
     <l n="86">He felt their scoffings were deserved of him ,</l>
     <l n="87">For he should gathered wisdom with his years ;</l>

   <p>MALINCHE .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION .</p>
   <p>I may properly place “ Malinche ” as supplementary to “ Montezuma , ” as dealing with characters coincident to , and cotemporaneous with those concerned in the “ Conquest , ” and also as covering a period subsequent to , and immediately succeeding the Conquest .</p>
   <p>To the student of history , Malinche ( in her position of interpreter during the entire period of the Conquest ) presents at once so much that is unique and charming , and yet such a sad commentary on the criminal practices of the sixteenth as well as the nineteenth centuries , that I have often wondered that a stronger and more practiced hand has not ere this claimed the privilege of championship .</p>
   <p>According to Prescott , she was born in the town of Painnalla , Province of Coatzacualco , in the southeastern extremity of what is now Mexico ; that she was the daughter of a Cacique ( a sort of provincial Governor ) and prospective heiress to large estates ; that after the death of her father , her mother , with indecent haste , forms another union , and in time presents the stepfather with a son ; that they jointly combine to be rid of Malinche , whom they sell to itinerant traders ; and , to cover their device , they pretend that she is sick and use the child of a servant for their criminal pantomime ; the child dies , thus completing the deception , except the hypocritical mourning to which this unnatural mother is said to have been equal .</p>
   <p>Malinche is sold by the traders to the Cacique of Tabasco , and reaches maturity about the time of the Conquest . She seems to have been a favorite in the house of the Cacique , which would indicate that he had become acquainted with her origin , and after the surrender of the town to Cortez , she is one of the twenty female slaves presented to the Conqueror and his allies .</p>
   <p>Either from enlarged opportunities or her natural aptness , and probably both , she is found by Cortez to be just the person he needs for interpreter . Mutual attraction leads them into the closest relations , and it is but just to Malinche to state that there is no indication of her knowledge of the Conqueror 's wife in Cuba , until she arrives at the Capitol . There is also nothing to indicate more than a momentary estrangement between Malinche and Catalina .</p>
   <p>Catalina lived but about three months after her arrival at Mexico ; and it seems that Malinche assumes the same relations as before , when Cortez journeys South , where in time they reach the precincts of the maiden 's nativity , and she meets her mother , after all the years of their cruel separation . Here the beautiful sincerity of the Christianity she had espoused , shines forth as she quiets her mother 's fears , and professes to doubt her mother 's original intent to sell her . She loads her mother with jewels and seems to cherish no feeling not consistent with the warmest relations of daughter and mother .</p>
   <p>The statement soon after is , that Cortez presents her to Don Xamarillo with all the sanction of marriage , and he enriches her with some of the largest estates in her native province ; and there the historic account closes . Incidentally , it is mentioned that a son was born during the period of this affaire du coeur .</p>
   <p>I stated that the historic account closes here , but M. Charny and others enlarge on the traditionary feeling of South Eastern Mexico , and if we may credit his statements ( and many times tradition carries more heart and more of the essential elements of truth in it than the cold pencil of history ) , Malinche is so woven into the social structure as to become almost the patron saint of that part of the country .</p>
   <p>And Prescott ( rather inclined to the fruit than the blossom of history ) speaks of Malinche as being reverently held by the Aztec descendants as the guardian angel of Chapultepec .</p>
   <p>I have endeavored thus to present the salient features of this part of the historic drama , adding and enlarging only as it became necessary to connect the events and do justice to the fair subject of the endeavor ; and whatever criticism may be offered , I can , without hesitancy , claim the credit of candor and a desire to eliminate from all the facts of the case the plain , unvarnished truth .</p>
   <p>I began at first to write the idyl in nine-syllabic measure , but soon found myself cramped in expression , and in recopying I have thrown off restraint and used the double terminal with both nine and ten syllables , having no desire and finding no occasion to use the eight syllable measure which Longfellow has so immortalized in the “ Song of Hiawatha . ”</p>
   <p>The sacred relations of man and wife , like those of any other sacrament entered into voluntarily , are no less binding in the spirit than in the letter of the law ; and it is a gratifying truth that the statutes of many of the States of the Union are being so remodeled as to recognize the fact , rather than the form of marriage ; and the tendency is , certainly toward the correction of many abuses , as leading to a more enlarged knowledge of social responsibilities .</p>
   <p>As long as the sad story of Malinche has a present application , and may be said to be the perspective of the grossly distorted foreground of our social structure , so long will its rehearsal have its use in the world ; and I only regret that a stronger hand and a more perfect pen might not have been loaned to its portrayal .</p>

     <l n="1">Fair Clime of the sunset ! more richly endowed</l>
     <l n="2">Than Hispan ’ the knightly , or Gallia the proud —</l>
     <l n="3">Where the lakes of old Scotia are lost in the maze</l>
     <l n="4">Of thy thousand that mirror their heavy fringed banks</l>
     <l n="5">Of mountain and crag , and the stateliest ranks</l>
     <l n="6">That ever stood sentinel-watch to the gaze</l>
     <l n="7">Of a sky bending closer , and breathing more near</l>
     <l n="8">Than the heart ever throbbed to the fall of a tear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Though the soul be as barren as Gobi 's bleak heath</l>
     <l n="10">And the spirit of song in the cold throes of death ,</l>
     <l n="11">Can humanity throttle the play of the breeze</l>
     <l n="12">O'er the harp that old Nature unwittingly strung ,</l>
     <l n="13">When the windows of Heaven wide open were flung ,</l>
     <l n="14">For a thousand years to thy masterful trees ?</l>
     <l n="15">Can the ear fail to hear , or the eye fail to see</l>
     <l n="16">Thy rich crown ! thy sweet song ! great Yo Semite ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Though the brow of Olympus be crowded with thrones ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the cliffs of Parnassus resound with the tones</l>
     <l n="19">Of the Muses that sang at the foot of their god ,</l>
     <l n="20">Not Apollo 's great steeds , nor the flame of his car ,</l>
     <l n="21">Nor Mars , with the terrible glitter of war ,</l>
     <l n="22">Can dazzle the face of thy sun and thy sod ,</l>
     <l n="23">Bright Star of the West ! Thou art Empire 's own idol ,</l>
     <l n="24">The steed of the lightning , untamed to the bridle !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">What is History 's wreath but a record of death !</l>
     <l n="26">Time breathes on the tablet , it fades with his breath ;</l>
     <l n="27">But Nature has written in language so strong</l>
     <l n="28">That Eternity 's finger alone can displace ,</l>
     <l n="29">And write its own letters to fill up the space .</l>
     <l n="30">Our castles are mountains — our history , long ,—</l>
     <l n="31">So long that we simply write God on the page ,</l>
     <l n="32">And leave other Nations to guess at our age .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Our song is the present ; God fills up the past ,</l>
     <l n="34">With his rock-written letters ; a volume so vast</l>
     <l n="35">No hand may transcribe what He leaves as his own .</l>
     <l n="36">From Sinai we came with his prophet of old ,</l>
     <l n="37">To the valley where glitters the altar of gold —</l>
     <l n="38">Shall we break , in our frenzy , the tables of stone ?</l>
     <l n="39">No ! the letters are fresh , and deep graven the hand .</l>
     <l n="40">Far too sacred our charge ! As He writ , let them stand !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">When these tablets of Nature shall yield to the brain ,</l>
     <l n="42">And some bard shall interpret the words they contain ,</l>
     <l n="43">What a song shall burst forth from the prison of thought !</l>
     <l n="44">As his hand shall pass over the magical strings ,</l>
     <l n="45">And each chord at his touch into unison springs ,</l>
     <l n="46">As the wing of his impulse is hastily caught ,</l>
     <l n="47">No harp more divine in the turn of the earth</l>
     <l n="48">Shall throb to the measures of sorrow and mirth !</l>
