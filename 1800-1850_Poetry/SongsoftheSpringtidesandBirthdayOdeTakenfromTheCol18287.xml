    <head>DEDICATION</head>
    <head>TO EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY</head>
     <l n="1">A sea-mew on a sea-king 's wrist alighting ,</l>
     <l n="2">As the north sea-wind caught and strained and curled</l>
     <l n="3">The raven-figured flag that led men fighting</l>
     <l n="4">From field to green field of the water-world ,</l>
     <l n="5">Might find such brief high favour at his hand</l>
     <l n="6">For wings imbrued with brine , with foam impearled ,</l>
     <l n="7">As these my songs require at yours on land ,</l>
     <l n="8">That durst not save for love 's free sake require ,</l>
     <l n="9">Being lightly born between the foam and sand ,</l>
     <l n="10">But reared by hope and memory and desire</l>
     <l n="11">Of lives that were and life that is to be ,</l>
     <l n="12">Even such as filled his heavenlier song with fire</l>
     <l n="13">Whose very voice , that sang to set man free ,</l>
     <l n="14">Was in your ears as ever in ours his lyre ,</l>
     <l n="15">Once , ere the flame received him from the sea .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THALASSIUS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Upon the flowery forefront of the year ,</l>
     <l n="2">One wandering by the grey-green April sea</l>
     <l n="3">Found on a reach of shingle and shallower sand</l>
     <l n="4">Inlaid with starrier glimmering jewellery</l>
     <l n="5">Left for the sun 's love and the light wind 's cheer</l>
     <l n="6">Along the foam-flowered strand</l>
     <l n="7">Breeze-brightened , something nearer sea than land</l>
     <l n="8">Though the last shoreward blossom-fringe was near ,</l>
     <l n="9">A babe asleep with flower-soft face that gleamed</l>
     <l n="10">To sun and seaward as it laughed and dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Too sure of either love for either 's fear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Albeit so birdlike slight and light , it seemed</l>
     <l n="13">Nor man nor mortal child of man , but fair</l>
     <l n="14">As even its twin-born tenderer spray-flowers were ,</l>
     <l n="15">That the wind scatters like an Oread 's hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">For when July strewed fire on earth and sea</l>
     <l n="17">The last time ere that year ,</l>
     <l n="18">Out of the flame of morn Cymothoe</l>
     <l n="19">Beheld one brighter than the sunbright sphere</l>
     <l n="20">Move toward her from its fieriest heart , whence trod</l>
     <l n="21">The live sun 's very God ,</l>
     <l n="22">Across the foam-bright water-ways that are</l>
     <l n="23">As heavenlier heavens with star for answering star ,</l>
     <l n="24">And on her eyes and hair and maiden mouth</l>
     <l n="25">Felt a kiss falling fierier than the South</l>
     <l n="26">And heard above afar</l>
     <l n="27">A noise of songs and wind-enamoured wings</l>
     <l n="28">And lutes and lyres of milder and mightier strings ,</l>
     <l n="29">And round the resonant radiance of his car</l>
     <l n="30">Where depth is one with height ,</l>
     <l n="31">Light heard as music , music seen as light .</l>
     <l n="32">And with that second moondawn of the spring 's</l>
     <l n="33">That fosters the first rose ,</l>
     <l n="34">A sun-child whiter than the sunlit snows</l>
     <l n="35">Was born out of the world of sunless things</l>
     <l n="36">That round the round earth flows and ebbs and flows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">But he that found the sea-flower by the sea</l>
     <l n="38">And took to foster like a graft of earth</l>
     <l n="39">Was born of man 's most highest and heavenliest birth ,</l>
     <l n="40">Free-born as winds and stars and waves are free ;</l>
     <l n="41">A warrior grey with glories more than years ,</l>
     <l n="42">Though more of years than change the quick to dead</l>
     <l n="43">Had rained their light and darkness on his head ;</l>
     <l n="44">A singer that in time 's and memory 's ears</l>
     <l n="45">Should leave such words to sing as all his peers</l>
     <l n="46">Might praise with hallowing heat of rapturous tears</l>
     <l n="47">Till all the days of human flight were fled .</l>
     <l n="48">And at his knees his fosterling was fed</l>
     <l n="49">Not with man 's wine and bread</l>
     <l n="50">Nor mortal mother-milk of hopes and fears ,</l>
     <l n="51">But food of deep memorial days long sped ;</l>
     <l n="52">For bread with wisdom and with song for wine</l>
     <l n="53">Clear as the full calm 's emerald hyaline .</l>
     <l n="54">And from his grave glad lips the boy would gather</l>
     <l n="55">Fine honey of song-notes goldener than gold ,</l>
     <l n="56">More sweet than bees make of the breathing heather ,</l>
     <l n="57">That he , as glad and bold ,</l>
     <l n="58">Might drink as they , and keep his spirit from cold .</l>
     <l n="59">And the boy loved his laurel-laden hair</l>
     <l n="60">As his own father 's risen on the eastern air ,</l>
     <l n="61">And that less white brow-binding bayleaf bloom</l>
     <l n="62">More than all flowers his father 's eyes relume ;</l>
     <l n="63">And those high songs he heard ,</l>
     <l n="64">More than all notes of any landward bird ,</l>
     <l n="65">More than all sounds less free</l>
     <l n="66">Than the wind 's quiring to the choral sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="67">High things the high song taught him ; how the breath</l>
     <l n="68">Too frail for life may be more strong than death ;</l>
     <l n="69">And this poor flash of sense in life , that gleams</l>
     <l n="70">As a ghost 's glory in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="71">More stabile than the world 's own heart 's root seems ,</l>
     <l n="72">By that strong faith of lordliest love which gives</l>
     <l n="73">To death 's own sightless-seeming eyes a light</l>
     <l n="74">Clearer , to death 's bare bones a verier might ,</l>
     <l n="75">Than shines or strikes from any man that lives .</l>
     <l n="76">How he that loves life overmuch shall die</l>
     <l n="77">The dog 's death , utterly :</l>
     <l n="78">And he that much less loves it than he hates</l>
     <l n="79">All wrongdoing that is done</l>
     <l n="80">Anywhere always underneath the sun</l>
     <l n="81">Shall live a mightier life than time 's or fate 's .</l>
     <l n="82">One fairer thing he shewed him , and in might</l>
     <l n="83">More strong than day and night</l>
     <l n="84">Whose strengths build up time 's towering period :</l>
     <l n="85">Yea , one thing stronger and more high than God ,</l>
     <l n="86">Which if man had not , then should God not be :</l>
     <l n="87">And that was Liberty .</l>
     <l n="88">And gladly should man die to gain , he said ,</l>
     <l n="89">Freedom ; and gladlier , having lost , lie dead .</l>
     <l n="90">For man 's earth was not , nor the sweet sea-waves</l>
     <l n="91">His , nor his own land , nor its very graves ,</l>
     <l n="92">Except they bred not , bore not , hid not slaves :</l>
     <l n="93">But all of all that is ,</l>
     <l n="94">Were one man free in body and soul , were his .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">And the song softened , even as heaven by night</l>
     <l n="96">Softens , from sunnier down to starrier light ,</l>
     <l n="97">And with its moonbright breath</l>
     <l n="98">Blessed life for death 's sake , and for life 's sake death .</l>
     <l n="99">Till as the moon 's own beam and breath confuse</l>
     <l n="100">In one clear hueless haze of glimmering hues</l>
     <l n="101">The sea 's line and the land 's line and the sky 's ,</l>
     <l n="102">And light for love of darkness almost dies ,</l>
     <l n="103">As darkness only lives for light 's dear love ,</l>
     <l n="104">Whose hands the web of night is woven of ,</l>
     <l n="105">So in that heaven of wondrous words were life</l>
     <l n="106">And death brought out of strife ;</l>
     <l n="107">Yea , by that strong spell of serene increase</l>
     <l n="108">Brought out of strife to peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="109">And the song lightened , as the wind at morn</l>
     <l n="110">Flashes , and even with lightning of the wind</l>
     <l n="111">Night 's thick-spun web is thinned</l>
     <l n="112">And all its weft unwoven and overworn</l>
     <l n="113">Shrinks , as might love from scorn .</l>
     <l n="114">And as when wind and light on water and land</l>
     <l n="115">Leap as twin gods from heavenward hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="116">And with the sound and splendour of their leap</l>
     <l n="117">Strike darkness dead , and daunt the spirit of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="118">And burn it up with fire ;</l>
     <l n="119">So with the light that lightened from the lyre</l>
     <l n="120">Was all the bright heat in the child 's heart stirred</l>
     <l n="121">And blown with blasts of music into flame</l>
     <l n="122">Till even his sense became</l>
     <l n="123">Fire , as the sense that fires the singing bird</l>
     <l n="124">Whose song calls night by name .</l>
     <l n="125">And in the soul within the sense began</l>
     <l n="126">The manlike passion of a godlike man ,</l>
     <l n="127">And in the sense within the soul again</l>
     <l n="128">Thoughts that make men of gods and gods of men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="129">For love the high song taught him : love that turns</l>
     <l n="130">God 's heart toward man as man 's to Godward ; love</l>
     <l n="131">That life and death and life are fashioned of ,</l>
     <l n="132">From the first breath that burns</l>
     <l n="133">Half kindled on the flowerlike yeanling 's lip ,</l>
     <l n="134">So light and faint that life seems like to slip ,</l>
     <l n="135">To that yet weaklier drawn</l>
     <l n="136">When sunset dies of night 's devouring dawn .</l>
     <l n="137">But the man dying not wholly as all men dies</l>
     <l n="138">If aught be left of his in live men 's eyes</l>
     <l n="139">Out of the dawnless dark of death to rise ;</l>
     <l n="140">If aught of deed or word</l>
     <l n="141">Be seen for all time or of all time heard .</l>
     <l n="142">Love , that though body and soul were overthrown</l>
     <l n="143">Should live for love 's sake of itself alone ,</l>
     <l n="144">Though spirit and flesh were one thing doomed and dead ,</l>
     <l n="145">Not wholly annihilated .</l>
     <l n="146">Seeing even the hoariest ash-flake that the pyre</l>
     <l n="147">Drops , and forgets the thing was once afire</l>
     <l n="148">And gave its heart to feed the pile 's full flame</l>
     <l n="149">Till its own heart its own heat overcame ,</l>
     <l n="150">Outlives its own life , though by scarce a span ,</l>
     <l n="151">As such men dying outlive themselves in man ,</l>
     <l n="152">Outlive themselves for ever ; if the heat</l>
     <l n="153">Outburn the heart that kindled it , the sweet</l>
     <l n="154">Outlast the flower whose soul it was , and flit</l>
     <l n="155">Forth of the body of it</l>
     <l n="156">Into some new shape of a strange perfume</l>
     <l n="157">More potent than its light live spirit of bloom ,</l>
     <l n="158">How shall not something of that soul relive ,</l>
     <l n="159">That only soul that had such gifts to give</l>
     <l n="160">As lighten something even of all men 's doom</l>
     <l n="161">Even from the labouring womb</l>
     <l n="162">Even to the seal set on the unopening tomb ?</l>
     <l n="163">And these the loving light of song and love</l>
     <l n="164">Shall wrap and lap round and impend above ,</l>
     <l n="165">Imperishable ; and all springs born illume</l>
     <l n="166">Their sleep with brighter thoughts than wake the dove</l>
     <l n="167">To music , when the hillside winds resume</l>
     <l n="168">The marriage-song of heather-flower and broom</l>
     <l n="169">And all the joy thereof .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="170">And hate the song too taught him : hate of all</l>
     <l n="171">That brings or holds in thrall</l>
     <l n="172">Of spirit or flesh , free-born ere God began ,</l>
     <l n="173">The holy body and sacred soul of man .</l>
     <l n="174">And wheresoever a curse was or a chain ,</l>
     <l n="175">A throne for torment or a crown for bane</l>
     <l n="176">Rose , moulded out of poor men 's molten pain ,</l>
     <l n="177">There , said he , should man 's heaviest hate be set</l>
     <l n="178">Inexorably , to faint not or forget</l>
     <l n="179">Till the last warmth bled forth of the last vein</l>
     <l n="180">In flesh that none should call a king 's again ,</l>
     <l n="181">Seeing wolves and dogs and birds that plague-strike air</l>
     <l n="182">Leave the last bone of all the carrion bare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="183">And hope the high song taught him : hope whose eyes</l>
     <l n="184">Can sound the seas unsoundable , the skies</l>
     <l n="185">Inaccessible of eyesight ; that can see</l>
     <l n="186">What earth beholds not , hear what wind and sea</l>
     <l n="187">Hear not , and speak what all these crying in one</l>
     <l n="188">Can speak not to the sun .</l>
     <l n="189">For in her sovereign eyelight all things are</l>
     <l n="190">Clear as the closest seen and kindlier star</l>
     <l n="191">That marries morn and even and winter and spring</l>
     <l n="192">With one love 's golden ring .</l>
     <l n="193">For she can see the days of man , the birth</l>
     <l n="194">Of good and death of evil things on earth</l>
     <l n="195">Inevitable and infinite , and sure</l>
     <l n="196">As present pain is , or herself is pure .</l>
     <l n="197">Yea , she can hear and see , beyond all things</l>
     <l n="198">That lighten from before Time 's thunderous wings</l>
     <l n="199">Through the awful circle of wheel-winged periods ,</l>
     <l n="200">The tempest of the twilight of all Gods :</l>
     <l n="201">And higher than all the circling course they ran</l>
     <l n="202">The sundawn of the spirit that was man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="203">And fear the song too taught him ; fear to be</l>
     <l n="204">Worthless the dear love of the wind and sea</l>
     <l n="205">That bred him fearless , like a sea-mew reared</l>
     <l n="206">In rocks of man 's foot feared ,</l>
     <l n="207">Where nought of wingless life may sing or shine .</l>
     <l n="208">Fear to wax worthless of that heaven he had</l>
     <l n="209">When all the life in all his limbs was glad</l>
     <l n="210">And all the drops in all his veins were wine</l>
     <l n="211">And all the pulses music ; when his heart ,</l>
     <l n="212">Singing , bade heaven and wind and sea bear part</l>
     <l n="213">In one live song 's reiterance , and they bore :</l>
     <l n="214">Fear to go crownless of the flower he wore</l>
     <l n="215">When the winds loved him and the waters knew ,</l>
     <l n="216">The blithest life that clove their blithe life through</l>
     <l n="217">With living limbs exultant , or held strife</l>
     <l n="218">More amorous than all dalliance aye anew</l>
     <l n="219">With the bright breath and strength of their large life ,</l>
