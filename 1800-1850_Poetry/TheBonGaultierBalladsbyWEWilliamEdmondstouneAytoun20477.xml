    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">A further edition of this book — the sixteenth — having been called for , I have been asked by the publishers to furnish a preface to it . For prefaces I have no love . Books should speak for themselves . Prefaces can scarcely be otherwise than egotistic , and one would not willingly add to the too numerous illustrations of this tendency with which the literature of the day abounds . I would much rather leave the volume with the simple “ Envoy ” which I wrote for it when the Bon Gaultier Ballads were first gathered into a volume . There the products of the dual authorship of Aytoun and myself were ascribed to the Bon Gaultier under whose editorial auspices they had for the most part seen the light . But my publishers tell me that people want to know why , and how , and by which of us these poems were written ,— curiosity , complimentary , no doubt , but which it is by no means easy for the surviving bard to satisfy . It is sixty years since most of these verses were written with the light heart and fluent pen of youth , and with no thought of their surviving beyond the natural life of ephemeral magazine pieces of humour . After a long and very crowded life , of which literature has occupied the smallest part , it is difficult for me to live back into the circumstances and conditions under which they were written , or to mark , except to a very limited extent , how far to Aytoun , and how far to myself , separately , the contents of the volume are to be assigned . I found this difficult when I wrote Aytoun 's Life in 1867 , and it is necessarily a matter of greater difficulty now in 1903 .</p>
    <p n="2">I can but endeavour to show how Aytoun and I came together , and how for two or three years we worked together in literature . Aytoun ( born 21st June 1813 ) was three years older than myself , and he was known already as a writer in ‘ Blackwood 's Magazine ’ when I made his acquaintance in 1841 . For some years I had been writing in Tait 's and Fraser 's Magazines , and elsewhere , articles and verses , chiefly humorous , both in prose and verse , under the nom de guerre of Bon Gaultier . This name , which seemed a good one for the author of playful and occasionally satirical papers , had caught my fancy in Rabelais , { vii } where he says of himself , “ A moy n'est que honneur et gloire d'estre diet et repute Bon Gaultier et bon Compaignon ; en ce nom , suis bien venue en toutes bonnes compaignees de Pantagruelistes . ”</p>
    <p n="3">It was to one of these papers that I owed my introduction to Aytoun . What its nature was may be inferred from its title — “ Flowers of Hemp ; or , The Newgate Garland . By One of the Family . ” Like most of the papers on which we subsequently worked together , the object was not merely to amuse , but also to strike at some prevailing literary craze or vitiation of taste . I have lived to see many such crazes since . Every decade seems to produce one . But the particular craze against which this paper was directed was the popularity of novels and songs , of which the ruffians of the Newgate Calendar were the accepted heroes . If my memory does not deceive me , it began with Harrison Ainsworth 's ‘ Rookwood , ’ in which the gallantries of Dick Turpin , and the brilliant description of his famous Ride to York , caught the public fancy . Encouraged by the success of this book , Ainsworth next wooed the sympathies of the public for Jack Sheppard and his associates in his novel of that name . The novel was turned into a melodrama , in which Mrs Keeley 's clever embodiment of that “ marvellous boy ” made for months and months the fortunes of the Adelphi Theatre ; while the sonorous musical voice of Paul Bedford as Blueskin in the same play brought into vogue a song with the refrain ,</p>
    <p n="4">“ Nix my dolly , pals , fake away ! ”</p>
    <p n="5">which travelled everywhere , and made the patter of thieves and burglars “ familiar in our mouths as household words . ” It deafened us in the streets , where it was as popular with the organ-grinders and German bands as Sullivan 's brightest melodies ever were in a later day . It clanged at midday from the steeple of St Giles , the Edinburgh cathedral ; { ix } it was whistled by every dirty “ gutter-snipe , ” and chanted in drawing-rooms by fair lips , that , little knowing the meaning of the words they sang , proclaimed to their admiring friends —</p>
    <p n="6">“ In a box of the stone jug I was born , Of a hempen widow the kid forlorn ; My noble father , as I 've heard say , Was a famous marchant of capers gay ; ”</p>
    <p n="7">ending with the inevitable and insufferable chorus ,</p>
    <p n="8">“ Nix my dolly , pals , fake away ! ”</p>
    <p n="9">Soon after the Newgate Calendar was appealed to for a hero by the author of ‘ Pelham , ’ who had already won no small distinction , and who in his ‘ Paul Clifford ’ did his best to throw a halo of romance around the highwayman 's career . Not satisfied with this , Bulwer next claimed the sympathies of his readers for Eugene Aram , and exalted a very common type of murderer into a nobly minded and highly sentimental scholar . Crime and criminals became the favourite theme of a multitude of novelists of a lower class . They even formed the central interest of the ‘ Oliver Twist ’ of Charles Dickens , whose Fagin and his pupil “ the Artful Dodger , ” Bill Sykes and Nancy , were simultaneously presented to us in their habits as they lived by the genius of George Cruikshank , with a power that gave a double interest to Dickens 's masterly delineation of these worthies .</p>
    <p n="10">The time seemed — in 1841 — to have come to open people 's eyes to the dangerous and degrading taste of the hour , and it struck me that this might be done by pushing to still further extravagance the praises which had been lavishly bestowed upon the gentlemen whose career generally terminated in Newgate or on the Tyburn Tree , and by giving “ the accomplishment of verse ” to the sentiments and the language which formed the staple of the popular thieves ’ literature of the circulating libraries . The medium chosen was the review of a manuscript , supposed to be sent to the writer by a man who had lived so fully up to his own convictions as to the noble vocation of those who set law at defiance , and lived by picking pockets , burglary , and highway robbery , diversified by an occasional murder , that , with the finisher of the law 's assistance , he had ended his exploits in what the slang of his class called “ a breakfast of hartichoke with caper sauce . ” How hateful the phrase ! But it was one of many such popularly current in those days .</p>
    <p n="11">The author of my “ Thieves ’ Anthology ” was described in my paper as a well-born man of good education , who , having ruined himself by his bad habits , had fallen into the criminal ranks , but had not forgotten the literae humaniores which he had learned at the Heidelberg University . Of the purpose with which he had written he spoke thus in what I described as the fragments of a preface to his Miscellany :—</p>
    <p n="12">“ To rescue from oblivion the martyrs of independence , to throw around the mighty names that flash upon us from the squalor of the Chronicles of Newgate the radiance of a storied imagination , to clothe the gibbet and the hulks ‘ in golden exhalations of the dawn , ’ and secure for the boozing-ken and the gin-palace that hold upon the general sympathies which has too long been monopolised by the cottage and the drawing-room , has been the aim and the achievement of many recent authors of distinction . How they have succeeded , let the populous state of the public jails attest . The office of ‘ dubsman ’ [ hangman ] has ceased to be a sinecure , and the public and Mr Joseph Hume have the satisfaction of knowing that these useful functionaries have now got something to do for their salaries . The number of their pupils has increased , is increasing , and is not likely to be diminished . But much remains to be done . Many an untenanted cell still echoes only to the sighs of its own loneliness . New jails are rising around us , which require to be filled . The Penitentiary presently erecting at Perth is of the most commodious description .</p>
    <p n="13">“ In this state of things I have bethought myself of throwing , in the words of Goethe , ‘ my corn into the great seed-field of time , ’ in the hope that it may blossom to purposes of great public utility . The aid of poetry has hitherto been but partially employed in the spread of a taste for Conveyancing , especially in its higher branches . Or where the Muse has shown herself , it has been but in the evanescent glimpses of a song . She has plumed her wings for no sustained flight . . . .</p>
    <p n="14">“ The power of poetry over the heart and impulses of man has been recognised by all writers from Aristotle down to Serjeant Talfourd . In dexterous hands it has been known to subvert a severe chastity by the insinuations of a holy flame , to clothe impurity in vestments ‘ bright with something of an angel light , ’ to exalt spleen into elevation of soul , and selfishness into a noble scorn of the world , and , with the ringing cadences of an enthusiastic style , to ennoble the vulgar and to sanctify the low . How much may be done , with an engine of such power , in increasing the numbers of ‘ The Family ’ may be conceived . The Muse of Faking , fair daughter of the herald Mercury , claims her place among ‘ The Mystic Nine . ’ Her language , erewhile slumbering in the pages of the Flash Dictionary , now lives upon the lips of all , even in the most fashionable circles . Ladies accost crossing-sweepers as ‘ dubsmen ’ ; whist-players are generally spoken of in gambling families as ‘ dummy-hunters ’ ; children in their nursery sports are accustomed to ‘ nix their dolls ’ ; and the all but universal summons to exertion of every description is ‘ Fake away ! ’</p>
    <p n="15">“ ‘ Words are things , ’ says Apollonius of Tyana . We cannot be long familiar with a symbol without becoming intimate with that which it expresses . Let the public mind , then , be in the habit of associating these and similar expressions with passages of poetical power , let the ideas they import be imbedded in their hearts and glorified in their imaginations , and the fairest results may with confidence be anticipated . ”</p>
    <p n="16">In song and sonnet and ballad these views were illustrated and enforced . They served the purpose of the ridicule which it was hoped might operate to cure people of the prevailing toleration for the romance of the slums and the thieves ’ kitchen . Naturally parody was freely used . Wordsworth did not escape . His</p>
    <p n="17">“ Milton , thou shouldst be living at this hour , ”</p>
    <p n="18">found its echo in</p>
    <p n="19">“ Turpin , thou shouldst be living at this hour , England hath need of thee , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="20">And his “ Great men have been among us , ” &amp; c ., was perverted into</p>
    <p n="21">“ Great men have been among us ,— Names that lend A lustre to our calling ; better none ; Maclaine , Duval , Dick Turpin , Barrington , Blueskin and others , who called Sheppard friend . . . . . . . . Now , ‘ tis strange , We never see such souls as we had then ; Perpetual larcenies and such small change ! No single cracksman paramount , no code , No master spirit , that will take the road , But equal dearth of pluck and highwaymen ! ”</p>
    <p n="22">Nor did even Shelley 's magnificent sonnet “ Ozymandias ” escape the profane hand of the burglar poet . He wrote ,—</p>
    <p n="23">“ I met a cracksman coming down the Strand , Who said , ‘ A huge Cathedral , piled of stone , Stands in a churchyard , near St Martin 's Le Grand , Where keeps Saint Paul his sacerdotal throne . A street runs by it to the northward . There For cab and bus is writ ‘ No Thoroughfare , ’ The Mayor and Councilmen do so command . And in that street a shop , with many a box , Upon whose sign these fateful words I scanned : ‘ My name is Chubb , who makes the Patent Locks ; Look on my works , ye burglars , and despair ! ’ Here made he pause , like one that sees a blight Mar all his hopes , and sighed with drooping air , ‘ Our game is up , my covies , blow me tight ! ’ ”</p>
    <p n="24">The versatile genius of the poet was equally at home in the simpler lyric region of the Haynes Bayley school . Taking for his model the favourite drawing-room ballad of the period , “ She wore a wreath of roses the night that first we met , ” he made a parody of its rhythmical cadence the medium for presenting some leading incidents in the career of a Circe of “ the boozing ken , ” as thus ,—</p>
    <p n="25">“ She wore a rouge like roses the night that first we met ; Her lovely mug was smiling o'er mugs of heavy wet ; Her red lips had the fulness , her voice the husky tone , That told her drink was of a kind where water was unknown . ”</p>
    <p n="26">Then after a few more glimpses of this charming creature in her downward progress , the bard wound up with this characteristic close to her public life ,—</p>
    <p n="27">“ I saw her but a moment , but methinks I see her now , As she dropped the judge a curtsey , and he made her a bow . ”</p>
    <p n="28">But it would be out of place to dwell longer upon those reckless imitations . The only poem which ultimately found a place in the Bon Gaultier volume was “ The Death of Duval . ”</p>
    <p n="29">The paper was a success . Aytoun was taken by it , and sought an introduction to me by our common friend Edward Forbes the eminent Naturalist , then a leading spirit among the students of the Edinburgh University , beloved and honoured by all who knew him . Aytoun 's name was familiar to me from his contributions to ‘ Blackwood 's Magazine , ’ and I was well pleased to make his acquaintance , which rapidly grew into intimate friendship , as it could not fail to do with a man of a nature so manly and genial , and so full of spontaneous humour , as well as of marked literary ability . His fancy had been caught by some of the things I had written in this and other papers under the name of Bon Gaultier , and when I proposed to go on with articles in a similar vein , he fell readily into the plan and agreed to assist in it . Thus a kind of Beaumont and Fletcher partnership was formed , which commenced in a series of humorous papers that were published in Tait 's and Fraser 's Magazines during the years 1842 , 1843 , and 1844 . In these papers appeared , with a few exceptions , the verses which form the present volume . They were only a portion , but no doubt the best portion , of a great number of poems and parodies which made the chief attraction of papers under such headings as “ Puffs and Poetry , ” “ My Wife 's Album , ” “ The Poets of the Day , ” and “ Cracknels for Christmas . ”</p>
    <p n="30">In the last of these the parody appeared under the name of “ The Jilted Gent , by Theodore Smifzer , ” which , as “ The Lay of the Lovelorn , ” has become perhaps the most popular of the series . I remember well Aytoun bringing to me some ten or a dozen lines of admirable parody of “ Locksley Hall . ” That poem had been published about two years before , and was at the time by no means widely known , but was enthusiastically admired by both Aytoun and myself . What these lines were I cannot now be sure , but certainly they were some of the best in the poem . They were too good to appear as a fragment in the paper I was engaged upon , and I set to work to mould them into the form of a complete poem , in which it is now known . It was introduced in the paper thus :—</p>
    <p n="31">“ There is a peculiar atrocity in the circumstances which gave rise to the following poem , that stirs even the Dead Sea of our sensibilities . The lady appears to have carried on a furious flirtation with the bard — a cousin of her own — which she , naturally perhaps , but certainly cruelly , terminated by marrying an old East Indian nabob , with a complexion like curry powder , innumerable lacs of rupees , and a woful lack of liver . A refusal by one 's cousin is a domestic treason of the most ruthless kind ; and , assuming the author 's statement to be substantially correct , we must say that the lady 's conduct was disgraceful . What her sensations must be on reading the following passionate appeal we cannot of course divine ; but if one spark of feeling lingers in her bosom , she must , for four-and-twenty hours at least , have little appetite for mulligatawny . ”</p>
    <p n="32">The reviewer then quotes the poem down to the general commination , ending with</p>
    <p n="33">“ Cursed be the clerk and parson ,— cursed be the whole concern ! ”</p>
    <p n="34">He then resumes his commentary :—</p>
    <p n="35">“ This sweeping system of anathema may be consonant to what the philosophers call a high and imaginative mood of passion , but it is surely as unjust as any fulminations that ever emanated from the Papal Chair . No doubt Cousin Amy behaved shockingly ; but why , on that account , should the Bank of England , incorporated by Royal Charter , or the most respectable practitioner who prepared the settlements , along with his innocent clerk , be handed over to the uncovenanted mercies of the foul fiend ? No , no , Smifzer , this will never do ! In a more manly strain is what follows . ”</p>
    <p n="36">The remainder of the poem is then given , ending with ,</p>
    <p n="37">“ Rest thee with thy yellow nabob , spider-hearted Cousin Amy ! ”</p>
    <p n="38">and the critic resumes :—</p>
    <p n="39">“ Bravo , Smifzer ! This is the right sort of thing — no wishy-washy snivelling about a wounded heart and all that kind of stuff , but savage sarcasm , the lava of a volcanic spirit . In a fine prophetic strain is that vision of Amy 's feelings as the inebriated nawab stumbles hazily into the drawing-room , steaming fulsomely of chilma ! And that picture of the African jungle , with Smifzer in puris mounted on a high-trotting giraffe , with his twelve dusky brides around him ,— Cruikshank alone could do it justice . But the triumph of the poem is in the high-toned sentiment of civilisation and moral duty , which , esteeming ‘ the grey barbarian ’ lower than the ‘ Christian cad , ’ — and that is low enough in all conscience ,— tears the captivating delusions of freedom and polygamy from the poet 's eyes , even when his pulse is throbbing at the wildest , and sends him from the shades of the palm and the orange tree to the advertising columns of the ‘ Morning Post . ’ This is indeed a great poem , and we need only add that the reader will find something like it in Mr Alfred Tennyson 's ‘ Locksley Hall . ’ There has been pilfering somewhere ; but Messieurs Smifzer and Tennyson must settle it between them . ”</p>
    <p n="40">How little did I dream , when writing this , that I should hear the parody quoted through the years up till now almost as often as the original poem ! Smifzer was wiser than Tennyson , for he never spoiled the effect of his poem by admitting , like Tennyson in his “ Locksley Hall , Sixty Years After , ” that it was a good thing that “ spider-hearted ” Amy threw him over as she did .</p>
    <p n="41">Luckily for us , not a few poets were then living whose style and manner of thought were sufficiently marked to make imitation easy , and sufficiently popular for a parody of their characteristics to be readily recognised . Lockhart 's “ Spanish Ballads ” were as familiar in the drawing-room as in the study . Macaulay 's “ Lays of Ancient Rome , ” and his two other fine ballads , were still in the freshness of their fame . Tennyson and Mrs Browning were opening up new veins . These , with Moore , Leigh Hunt , Uhland , and others of minor note , lay ready to our hands , as Scott , Byron , Crabbe , Coleridge , Moore , Wordsworth , and Southey had done to James and Horace Smith in 1812 , when writing the “ Rejected Addresses . ” Never , probably , were verses thrown off with a keener sense of enjoyment , and assuredly the poets parodied had no warmer admirers than ourselves . Very pleasant were the hours when we met , and now Aytoun and now myself would suggest the subjects for each successive article , and the verses with which they were to be illustrated . Most commonly this was done in our rambles to favourite spots in the suburbs of “ our own romantic town , ” on Arthur Seat , or by the shores of the Forth , and at other times as we sat together of an evening , when the duties of the day were over , and joined in putting line after line together until the poem was completed . In writing thus for our own amusement we never dreamed that these “ nugae literariae ” would live beyond the hour . It was , therefore , a pleasant surprise when we found to what an extent they became popular , not only in England , but also in America , which had come in for no small share of severe though well-meant ridicule . In those days who could say what fate might have awaited us had we visited the States , and Aytoun been known to be the author of “ The Lay of Mr Colt ” and “ The Fight with the Snapping Turtle , ” or myself as the chronicler of “ The Death of Jabez Dollar ” and “ The Alabama Duel ” ? As it was , our transatlantic friends took a liberal revenge by instantly pirating the volume , and selling it by thousands with a contemptuous disregard of author 's copyright .</p>
    <p n="42">For Aytoun the extravagances of melodrama and the feats and eccentricities of the arena at Astley 's amphitheatre had always a peculiar charm . “ The terrible Fitzball , ” the English Dumas , in quantity , not quality , of melodrama , Gomersal , one of the chief equestrians , and Widdicomb , the master of the ring at Astley 's , were three of his favourite heroes . Ducrow , manager of Astley 's , the most daring and graceful of equestrians , and the fair Miss Woolford , the star of his troupe , had charms irresistible for all lovers of the circus . In Aytoun 's enthusiasm I fully shared . Mine found expression in “ The Courtship of our Cid , ” Aytoun 's in “ Don Fernando Gomersalez , ” in which I recognise many of my own lines , but of which the conception and the best part of the verses were his . Years afterwards his delight in the glories of the ring broke out in the following passage in a too-good-to-be-forgotten article in ‘ Blackwood , ’ which , to those who may never hope to see in any circus anything so inspiring , so full of an imaginative glamour , may give some idea of the nightly scenes in the halcyon days of Astley 's :—</p>
    <p n="43">“ We delight to see , at never-failing Astley 's , the revived glories of British prowess — Wellington in the midst of his staff , smiling benignantly on the facetious pleasantries of a Fitzroy Somerset — Sergeant M'Craw of the Forty-Second delighting the elite of Brussels by the performance of the reel of Tullochgorum at the Duchess of Richmond 's ball — the charge of the Scots Greys — the single-handed combat of Marshal Ney and the infuriated Life-Guardsman Shaw — and the final retreat of Napoleon amidst a volley of Roman candles and the flames of an arsenicated Hougomont . Nor is our gratification less to discern , after the subsiding of the showers of sawdust so gracefully scattered by that groom in the doeskin integuments , the stately form of Widdicomb , cased in martial apparel , advancing towards the centre of the ring , and commanding — with imperious gesture , and some slight flagellation in return for dubious compliment — the double-jointed clown to assist the Signora Cavalcanti to her seat upon the celebrated Arabian . How lovely looks the lady , as she vaults to her feet upon the breadth of the yielding saddle ! With what inimitable grace does she whirl these tiny banners around her head , as winningly as a Titania performing the sword exercise ! How coyly does she dispose her garments and floating drapery to hide the too-maddening symmetry of her limbs ! Gods ! She is transformed all at once into an Amazon — the fawn-like timidity of her first demeanour is gone . Bold and beautiful flushes her cheek with animated crimson — her full voluptuous lip is more compressed and firm — the deep passion of the huntress flashing in her lustrous eyes ! Widdicomb becomes excited — he moves with quicker step around the periphery of his central circle — incessant is the smacking of his whip — not this time directed against Mr Merriman , who at his ease is enjoying a swim upon the sawdust — and lo ! the grooms rush in , six bars are elevated in a trice , and over them all bounds the volatile Signora like a panther , nor pauses until with airy somersets she has passed twice through the purgatory of the blazing hoop , and then , drooping and exhausted , sinks like a Sabine into the arms of the Herculean master , who — a second Romulus — bears away his lovely burden to the stables , amid such a whirlwind of applause as Kemble might have been proud to earn . ”</p>
    <p n="44">Astley 's has long been levelled with the dust ; it is many years since Widdicomb , Gomersal , Ducrow , and the Woolford passed into the Silent Land . May their memory be preserved for yet a few years to come in the mirthful strains of two of their most ardent and grateful admirers !</p>
    <p n="45">Of the longer poems in this volume the following were exclusively Aytoun 's : “ The Broken Pitcher , ” “ The Massacre of the Macpherson , ” “ The Rhyme of Sir Launcelot Bogle , ” “ Little John and the Red Friar , ” “ A Midnight Meditation , ” and that admirable imitation of the Scottish ballad , “ The Queen in France . ” Some of the shorter poems were also his — “ The Lay of the Levite , ” “ Tarquin and the Augur , ” “ La Mort d'Arthur , ” “ The Husband 's Petition , ” and the “ Sonnet to Britain . ” The rest were either wholly mine or produced by us jointly .</p>
    <p n="46">After 1844 the Bon Gaultier co-operation ceased . My profession and removal from Edinburgh to London left no leisure or opportunity for work of that kind , and Aytoun became busy with the Professorship of Belles Lettres in the University and with his work at the Bar and on ‘ Blackwood 's Magazine . ’ We had also during the Bon Gaultier period worked together in a series of translations of Goethe 's Poems and Ballads for ‘ Blackwood 's Magazine , ’ which , like the Bon Gaultier Ballads , were collected , added to , and published in a volume a year or two afterwards . In 1845 I left Edinburgh for London , and only met Aytoun at intervals there or at Homburg in the future years ; but our friendship was kept alive by active correspondence . Literature was naturally his vocation , and he wrote much and well , with exemplary industry , enlivening his papers in ‘ Blackwood , ’ till his death in August 1865 , with the same manly sense , the same playfulness of fancy and flow of spontaneous humour , which made his society and his letters always delightful to his friends .</p>
    <p n="47">“ Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit , Nulli flebilior quam mihi ! ”</p>
    <p n="48">The first edition of this book , now very rare , appeared in 1845 . It was illustrated by Alfred Henry Forrester ( Alfred Crowquill ) . In the subsequent editions drawings by Richard Doyle and John Leech , in a kindred spirit of fanciful extravagance , were added , and helped materially towards the attractions of the volume . Its popularity surpassed the utmost expectations of the authors . To them not the least pleasant feature of its success was that it was widely read both in the Navy and the Army , and was nowhere more in demand than in the trenches before Sebastopol in 1854 .</p>

     <l n="1">Come , buy my lays , and read them if you list ;</l>
     <l n="2">My pensive public , if you list not , buy .</l>
     <l n="3">Come , for you know me . I am he who sang</l>
     <l n="4">Of Mister Colt , and I am he who framed</l>
     <l n="5">Of Widdicomb the wild and wondrous song .</l>
     <l n="6">Come , listen to my lays , and you shall hear</l>
     <l n="7">How Wordsworth , battling for the Laureate 's wreath ,</l>
     <l n="8">Bore to the dust the terrible Fitzball ;</l>
     <l n="9">How N. P. Willis for his country 's good ,</l>
     <l n="10">In complete steel , all bowie-knived at point ,</l>
     <l n="11">Took lodgings in the Snapping Turtle 's womb .</l>
     <l n="12">Come , listen to my lays , and you shall hear</l>
     <l n="13">The mingled music of all modern bards</l>
     <l n="14">Floating aloft in such peculiar strains ,</l>
     <l n="15">As strike themselves with envy and amaze ;</l>
     <l n="16">For you “ bright-harped ” Tennyson shall sing ;</l>
     <l n="17">Macaulay chant a more than Roman lay ;</l>
     <l n="18">And Bulwer Lytton , Lytton Bulwer erst ,</l>
     <l n="19">Unseen amidst a metaphysic fog ,</l>
     <l n="20">Howl melancholy homage to the moon ;</l>
     <l n="21">For you once more Montgomery shall rave</l>
     <l n="22">In all his rapt rabidity of rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nankeened Cockaigne shall pipe his puny note ,</l>

     <l n="1">The Broken Pitcher .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">It was a Moorish maiden was sitting by a well ,</l>
     <l n="3">And what the maiden thought of , I cannot , cannot tell ,</l>
     <l n="4">When by there rode a valiant knight from the town of Oviedo —</l>
     <l n="5">Alphonzo Guzman was he hight , the Count of Tololedo .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ Oh , maiden , Moorish maiden , why sit'st thou by the spring ?</l>
     <l n="7">Say , dost thou seek a lover , or any other thing ?</l>
     <l n="8">Why dost thou look upon me , with eyes so dark and wide ,</l>
     <l n="9">And wherefore doth the pitcher lie broken by thy side ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">“ I do not seek a lover , thou Christian knight so gay ,</l>
     <l n="11">Because an article like that hath never come my way ;</l>
     <l n="12">And why I gaze upon you , I cannot , cannot tell ,</l>
     <l n="13">Except that in your iron hose you look uncommon swell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">“ My pitcher it is broken , and this the reason is ,—</l>
     <l n="15">A shepherd came behind me , and tried to snatch a kiss ;</l>
     <l n="16">I would not stand his nonsense , so ne'er a word I spoke ,</l>
     <l n="17">But scored him on the costard , and so the jug was broke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">“ My uncle , the Alcayde , he waits for me at home ,</l>
     <l n="19">And will not take his tumbler until Zorayda come :</l>
     <l n="20">I cannot bring him water — the pitcher is in pieces —</l>
     <l n="21">And so I 'm sure to catch it , ‘ cos he wallops all his nieces . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">“ Oh , maiden , Moorish maiden ! wilt thou be ruled by me ?</l>
     <l n="23">Then wipe thine eyes and rosy lips , and give me kisses three ;</l>
     <l n="24">And I 'll give thee my helmet , thou kind and courteous lady ,</l>
     <l n="25">To carry home the water to thy uncle , the Alcayde . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">He lighted down from off his steed — he tied him to a tree —</l>
     <l n="27">He bent him to the maiden , and he took his kisses three ;</l>
     <l n="28">“ To wrong thee , sweet Zorayda , I swear would be a sin ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">And he knelt him at the fountain , and he dipped his helmet in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">Up rose the Moorish maiden — behind the knight she steals ,</l>
     <l n="31">And caught Alphonzo Guzman in a twinkling by the heels :</l>
     <l n="32">She tipped him in , and held him down beneath the bubbling water ,—</l>
     <l n="33">“ Now , take thou that for venturing to kiss Al Hamet 's daughter ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">A Christian maid is weeping in the town of Oviedo ;</l>
     <l n="35">She waits the coming of her love , the Count of Tololedo .</l>
     <l n="36">I pray you all in charity , that you will never tell ,</l>
     <l n="37">How he met the Moorish maiden beside the lonely well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">Don Fernando Gomersalez .</l>
     <l n="39">From the Spanish of Astley 's .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="40">Don Fernando Gomersalez ! { 7 } basely have they borne thee down ;</l>
     <l n="41">Paces ten behind thy charger is thy glorious body thrown ;</l>
     <l n="42">Fetters have they bound upon thee — iron fetters , fast and sure ;</l>
     <l n="43">Don Fernando Gomersalez , thou art captive to the Moor !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="44">Long within a dingy dungeon pined that brave and noble knight ,</l>
     <l n="45">For the Saracenic warriors well they knew and feared his might ;</l>
     <l n="46">Long he lay and long he languished on his dripping bed of stone ,</l>
     <l n="47">Till the cankered iron fetters ate their way into his bone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="48">On the twentieth day of August — ‘ twas the feast of false Mahound —</l>
     <l n="49">Came the Moorish population from the neighbouring cities round ;</l>
     <l n="50">There to hold their foul carousal , there to dance and there to sing ,</l>
     <l n="51">And to pay their yearly homage to Al-Widdicomb , { 8 } the King !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="52">First they wheeled their supple coursers , wheeled them at their utmost</l>
     <l n="53">speed ,</l>
     <l n="54">Then they galloped by in squadrons , tossing far the light jereed ;</l>
     <l n="55">Then around the circus racing , faster than the swallow flies ,</l>
     <l n="56">Did they spurn the yellow sawdust in the rapt spectators ’ eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="57">Proudly did the Moorish monarch every passing warrior greet ,</l>
     <l n="58">As he sate enthroned above them , with the lamps beneath his feet ;</l>
     <l n="59">“ Tell me , thou black-bearded Cadi ! are there any in the land ,</l>
     <l n="60">That against my janissaries dare one hour in combat stand ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="61">Then the bearded Cadi answered — “ Be not wroth , my lord the King ,</l>
     <l n="62">If thy faithful slave shall venture to observe one little thing ;</l>
     <l n="63">Valiant , doubtless , are thy warriors , and their beards are long and</l>
     <l n="64">hairy ,</l>
     <l n="65">And a thunderbolt in battle is each bristly janissary :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">“ But I cannot , O my sovereign , quite forget that fearful day ,</l>
     <l n="67">When I saw the Christian army in its terrible array ;</l>
     <l n="68">When they charged across the footlights like a torrent down its bed ,</l>
     <l n="69">With the red cross floating o'er them , and Fernando at their head !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">“ Don Fernando Gomersalez ! matchless chieftain he in war ,</l>
     <l n="71">Mightier than Don Sticknejo , { 11 } braver than the Cid Bivar !</l>
     <l n="72">Not a cheek within Grenada , O my king , but wan and pale is ,</l>
     <l n="73">When they hear the dreaded name of Don Fernando Gomersalez ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="74">“ Thou shalt see thy champion , Cadi ! hither quick the captive bring ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">Thus in wrath and deadly anger spoke Al-Widdicomb , the King :</l>
     <l n="76">“ Paler than a maiden 's forehead is the Christian 's hue , I ween ,</l>
     <l n="77">Since a year within the dungeons of Grenada he hath been ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="78">Then they brought the Gomersalez , and they led the warrior in ;</l>
     <l n="79">Weak and wasted seemed his body , and his face was pale and thin ;</l>
     <l n="80">But the ancient fire was burning , unsubdued , within his eye ,</l>
     <l n="81">And his step was proud and stately , and his look was stern and high .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="82">Scarcely from tumultuous cheering could the galleried crowd refrain ,</l>
     <l n="83">For they knew Don Gomersalez and his prowess in the plain ;</l>
     <l n="84">But they feared the grizzly despot and his myrmidons in steel ,</l>
     <l n="85">So their sympathy descended in the fruitage of Seville . { 12 }</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="86">“ Wherefore , monarch , hast thou brought me from the dungeon dark and</l>
     <l n="87">drear ,</l>
     <l n="88">Where these limbs of mine have wasted in confinement for a year ?</l>
     <l n="89">Dost thou lead me forth to torture ?— Rack and pincers I defy !</l>
     <l n="90">Is it that thy base grotesquos may behold a hero die ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="91">“ Hold thy peace , thou Christian caitiff , and attend to what I say !</l>
     <l n="92">Thou art called the starkest rider of the Spanish cur 's array</l>
     <l n="93">If thy courage be undaunted , as they say it was of yore ,</l>
     <l n="94">Thou mayst yet achieve thy freedom ,— yet regain thy native shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="95">“ Courses three within this circus ‘ gainst my warriors shalt thou run ,</l>
     <l n="96">Ere yon weltering pasteboard ocean shall receive yon muslin sun ;</l>
     <l n="97">Victor — thou shalt have thy freedom ; but if stretched upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="98">To thy dark and dreary dungeon they shall hale thee back again . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="99">“ Give me but the armour , monarch , I have worn in many a field ,</l>
     <l n="100">Give me but my trusty helmet , give me but my dinted shield ;</l>
     <l n="101">And my old steed , Bavieca , swiftest courser in the ring ,</l>
     <l n="102">And I rather should imagine that I 'll do the business , King ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="103">Then they carried down the armour from the garret where it lay ,</l>
     <l n="104">Oh ! but it was red and rusty , and the plumes were shorn away :</l>
     <l n="105">And they led out Bavieca from a foul and filthy van ,</l>
     <l n="106">For the conqueror had sold him to a Moorish dog'shYpppHeNmeat man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="107">When the steed beheld his master , loud he whinnied loud and free ,</l>
     <l n="108">And , in token of subjection , knelt upon each broken knee ;</l>
     <l n="109">And a tear of walnut largeness to the warrior 's eyelids rose ,</l>
     <l n="110">As he fondly picked a bean-straw from his coughing courser 's nose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="111">“ Many a time , O Bavieca , hast thou borne me through the fray !</l>
     <l n="112">Bear me but again as deftly through the listed ring this day ;</l>
     <l n="113">Or if thou art worn and feeble , as may well have come to pass ,</l>
     <l n="114">Time it is , my trusty charger , both of us were sent to grass ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="115">Then he seized his lance , and , vaulting , in the saddle sate upright ;</l>
     <l n="116">Marble seemed the noble courser , iron seemed the mailed knight ;</l>
     <l n="117">And a cry of admiration burst from every Moorish lady .</l>
     <l n="118">“ Five to four on Don Fernando ! ” cried the sable-bearded Cadi .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="119">Warriors three from Alcantara burst into the listed space ,</l>
     <l n="120">Warriors three , all bred in battle , of the proud Alhambra race :</l>
     <l n="121">Trumpets sounded , coursers bounded , and the foremost straight went down ,</l>
     <l n="122">Tumbling , like a sack of turnips , right before the jeering Clown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="123">In the second chieftain galloped , and he bowed him to the King ,</l>
     <l n="124">And his saddle-girths were tightened by the Master of the Ring ;</l>
     <l n="125">Through three blazing hoops he bounded ere the desperate fight began —</l>
     <l n="126">Don Fernando ! bear thee bravely !— ‘ tis the Moor Abdorrhaman !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="127">Like a double streak of lightning , clashing in the sulphurous sky ,</l>
     <l n="128">Met the pair of hostile heroes , and they made the sawdust fly ;</l>
     <l n="129">And the Moslem spear so stiffly smote on Don Fernando 's mail ,</l>
     <l n="130">That he reeled , as if in liquor , back to Bavieca 's tail :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="131">But he caught the mace beside him , and he gripped it hard and fast ,</l>
     <l n="132">And he swung it starkly upwards as the foeman bounded past ;</l>
     <l n="133">And the deadly stroke descended through the skull and through the brain ,</l>
     <l n="134">As ye may have seen a poker cleave a cocoa-nut in twain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="135">Sore astonished was the monarch , and the Moorish warriors all ,</l>
     <l n="136">Save the third bold chief , who tarried and beheld his brethren fall ;</l>
     <l n="137">And the Clown , in haste arising from the footstool where he sat ,</l>
     <l n="138">Notified the first appearance of the famous Acrobat ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="139">Never on a single charger rides that stout and stalwart Moor ,—</l>
     <l n="140">Five beneath his stride so stately bear him o'er the trembling floor ;</l>
     <l n="141">Five Arabians , black as midnight — on their necks the rein he throws ,</l>
     <l n="142">And the outer and the inner feel the pressure of his toes . { 18 }</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="143">Never wore that chieftain armour ; in a knot himself he ties ,</l>
     <l n="144">With his grizzly head appearing in the centre of his thighs ,</l>
     <l n="145">Till the petrified spectator asks , in paralysed alarm ,</l>
     <l n="146">Where may be the warrior 's body ,— which is leg , and which is arm ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="147">“ Sound the charge ! ” The coursers started ; with a yell and furious vault ,</l>
     <l n="148">High in air the Moorish champion cut a wondrous somersault ;</l>
     <l n="149">O'er the head of Don Fernando like a tennis-ball he sprung ,</l>
     <l n="150">Caught him tightly by the girdle , and behind the crupper hung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="151">Then his dagger Don Fernando plucked from out its jewelled sheath ,</l>
     <l n="152">And he struck the Moor so fiercely , as he grappled him beneath ,</l>
     <l n="153">That the good Damascus weapon sank within the folds of fat ,</l>
     <l n="154">And as dead as Julius Caesar dropped the Gordian Acrobat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="155">Meanwhile fast the sun was sinking — it had sunk beneath the sea ,</l>
     <l n="156">Ere Fernando Gomersalez smote the latter of the three ;</l>
     <l n="157">And Al-Widdicomb , the monarch , pointed , with a bitter smile ,</l>
     <l n="158">To the deeply-darkening canvas ;— blacker grew it all the while .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="159">“ Thou hast slain my warriors , Spaniard ! but thou hast not kept thy time ;</l>
     <l n="160">Only two had sunk before thee ere I heard the curfew chime ;</l>
     <l n="161">Back thou goest to thy dungeon , and thou may'st be wondrous glad ,</l>
     <l n="162">That thy head is on thy shoulders for thy work to-day , my lad !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="163">“ Therefore all thy boasted valour , Christian dog , of no avail is ! ”</l>
     <l n="164">Dark as midnight grew the brow of Don Fernando Gomersalez :—</l>
     <l n="165">Stiffly sate he in his saddle , grimly looked around the ring ,</l>
     <l n="166">Laid his lance within the rest , and shook his gauntlet at the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">

     <l n="73">The Lay of Mr Colt .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note>The story of Mr Colt , of which our Lay contains merely the sequel , is this : A New York printer , of the name of Adams , had the effrontery to call upon him one day for payment of an account , which the independent Colt settled by cutting his creditor 's head to fragments with an axe . He then packed his body in a box , and sprinkling it with salt , despatched it to a packet bound for New Orleans . Suspicions having been excited , he was seized and tried before Judge Kent . The trial is , perhaps , the most disgraceful upon the records of any country . The ruffian 's mistress was produced in court , and examined , in disgusting detail , as to her connection with Colt , and his movements during the days and nights succeeding the murder . The head of the murdered man was bandied to and fro in the court , handed up to the jury , and commented on by witnesses and counsel ; and to crown the horrors of the whole proceeding , the wretch 's own counsel , a Mr Emmet , commencing the defence with a cool admission that his client took the life of Adams , and following it up by a detail of the whole circumstances of this most brutal murder in the first person , as though he himself had been the murderer , ended by telling the jury , that his client was “ entitled to the sympathy of a jury of his country , ” as “ a young man just entering into life , whose prospects , probably , have been permanently blasted . ” Colt was found guilty ; but a variety of exceptions were taken to the charge by the judge , and after a long series of appeals , which occupied more than a year from the date of conviction , the sentence of death was ratified by Governor Seward . The rest of Colt 's story is told in our ballad .</note>

     <l n="11">They say that I am stern of mood , because , like salted beef ,</l>
     <l n="12">I packed my quartered foeman up , and marked him ‘ prime tariff ; ’</l>
     <l n="13">Because I thought to palm him on the simple-souled John Bull ,</l>
     <l n="14">And clear a small percentage on the sale at Liverpool ;</l>
     <l n="15">It may be so , I do not know — these things , perhaps , may be ;</l>

   <note>Before the following poem , which originally appeared in ‘ Fraser 's Magazine , ’ could have reached America , intelligence was received in this country of an affray in Congress , very nearly the counterpart of that which the Author has here imagined in jest . It was very clear , to any one who observed the then state of public planners in America , that such occurrences must happen , sooner or later . The Americans apparently felt the force of the satire , as the poem was widely reprinted throughout the States . It subsequently returned to this country , embodied in an American work on American manners , where it characteristically appeared as the writer 's own production ; and it afterwards went the round of British newspapers , as an amusing satire , by an American , of his countrymen 's foibles !</note>

     <l n="109">The American 's Apostrophe to Boz .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note>So rapidly does oblivion do its work nowadays that the burst of amiable indignation with which America received the issue of his American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit is now almost wholly forgotten . Not content with waging a universal rivalry in the piracy of the Notes , Columbia showered upon its author the riches of its own choice vocabulary of abuse ; while some of her more fiery spirits threw out playful hints as to the propriety of gouging the “ stranger , ” and furnishing him with a permanent suit of tar and feathers , in the then very improbable event of his paying them a second visit . The perusal of these animated expressions of free opinion suggested the following lines , which those who remember Boz 's book , and the festivities with which he was all but hunted to death , will at once understand . The object aimed at was to do justice to the bitterness and “ immortal hate ” of these thin-skinned sons of freedom . Happily the storm passed over : Dickens paid , in 1867-68 , a second visit to the States , was well received , made a not inconsiderable fortune by his Readings there , and confessed that he had judged his American hosts harshly on his former visit .</note>

     <l n="2">Once — ‘ twas when I lived at Jena —</l>
     <l n="3">At a Wirthshaus ’ door I sat ;</l>
     <l n="4">And in pensive contemplation</l>
     <l n="5">Ate the sausage thick and fat ;</l>
     <l n="6">Ate the kraut that never sourer</l>
     <l n="7">Tasted to my lips than here ;</l>
     <l n="8">Smoked my pipe of strong canaster ,</l>
     <l n="9">Sipped my fifteenth jug of beer ;</l>
     <l n="10">Gazed upon the glancing river ,</l>
     <l n="11">Gazed upon the tranquil pool ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whence the silver-voiced Undine ,</l>
     <l n="13">When the nights were calm and cool ,</l>
     <l n="14">As the Baron Fouque tells us ,</l>
     <l n="15">Rose from out her shelly grot ,</l>
     <l n="16">Casting glamour o'er the waters ,</l>
     <l n="17">Witching that enchanted spot .</l>
     <l n="18">From the shadow which the coppice</l>
     <l n="19">Flings across the rippling stream ,</l>
     <l n="20">Did I hear a sound of music —</l>
     <l n="21">Was it thought or was it dream ?</l>
     <l n="22">There , beside a pile of linen ,</l>
     <l n="23">Stretched along the daisied sward ,</l>
     <l n="24">Stood a young and blooming maiden —</l>
     <l n="25">‘ Twas her thrush-like song I heard .</l>
     <l n="26">Evermore within the eddy</l>
     <l n="27">Did she plunge the white chemise ;</l>
     <l n="28">And her robes were loosely gathered</l>
     <l n="29">Rather far above her knees ;</l>
     <l n="30">Then my breath at once forsook me ,</l>
     <l n="31">For too surely did I deem</l>
     <l n="32">That I saw the fair Undine</l>
     <l n="33">Standing in the glancing stream —</l>
     <l n="34">And I felt the charm of knighthood ;</l>
     <l n="35">And from that remembered day ,</l>

     <l n="41">With my lute and with my song ;</l>
     <l n="42">Sang in mellow-toned soprano</l>
     <l n="43">All my love and all my woe ,</l>
     <l n="44">Till the river-maiden answered ,</l>
     <l n="45">Lilting in the stream below :—</l>
     <l n="46">“ Fair Undine ! sweet Undine !</l>
     <l n="47">Dost thou love as I love thee ? ”</l>

     <l n="58">To the well-accustomed signal</l>
     <l n="59">No response the maiden gave ;</l>
     <l n="60">But I heard the waters washing</l>
     <l n="61">And the moaning of the wave .</l>
     <l n="62">Vanished was my own Undine ,</l>
     <l n="63">All her linen , too , was gone ;</l>
     <l n="64">And I walked about lamenting</l>
     <l n="65">On the river bank alone .</l>

     <l n="69">Had she tin , or whence she came ?</l>
     <l n="70">So I took my trusty meerschaum ,</l>

     <l n="72">Wandered forth in minstrel fashion ,</l>
     <l n="73">Underneath the louring skies :</l>
     <l n="74">Sang before each comely Wirthshaus ,</l>
     <l n="75">Sang beside each purling stream ,</l>
     <l n="76">That same ditty which I chanted</l>
     <l n="77">When Undine was my theme ,</l>
     <l n="78">Singing , as I sang at Jena ,</l>
     <l n="79">When the shifts were hung to dry ,</l>

     <l n="87">No sweet voice to mine replied ;</l>

   <p>[ The six following Poems were among those forwarded to the Home Secretary , by the unsuccessful competitors for the Laureateship , on its becoming vacant by the death of Southey . How they came into our possession is a matter between Sir James Graham and ourselves . The result of the contest could never have been doubtful , least of all to the great poet who then succeeded to the bays . His own sonnet on the subject is full of the serene consciousness of superiority , which does not even admit the idea of rivalry , far less of defeat .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Bays ! which in former days have graced the brow</l>
     <l n="2">Of some , who lived and loved , and sang and died ;</l>
     <l n="3">Leaves that were gathered on the pleasant side</l>
     <l n="4">Of old Parnassus from Apollo 's bough ;</l>
     <l n="5">With palpitating hand I take thee now ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since worthier minstrel there is none beside ,</l>
     <l n="7">And with a thrill of song half deified ,</l>
     <l n="8">I bind them proudly on my locks of snow .</l>
     <l n="9">There shall they bide , till he who follows next ,</l>
     <l n="10">Of whom I cannot even guess the name ,</l>
     <l n="11">Shall by Court favour , or some vain pretext</l>
     <l n="12">Of fancied merit , desecrate the same ,—</l>
     <l n="13">And think , perchance , he wears them quite as well</l>
     <l n="14">As the sole bard who sang of Peter Bell ! ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The above note , which appeared in the first and subsequent editions of this volume , is characteristic of the audacious spirit of fun in which Bon Gaultier revelled . The sonnet here ascribed to Wordsworth must have been believed by some matter-of-fact people to be really by him . On his death in 1857 , in an article on the subject of the vacant Laureate-ship , it was quoted in a leading journal as proof of Wordsworth 's complacent estimate of his own supremacy over all contemporary poets . In writing the sonnet I was well aware that there was some foundation for his not unjust high appreciation of his own prowess , as the phrase “ sole bard ” pretty clearly indicates , but I never dreamt that any one would fail to see the joke .</p>

     <l n="1">Like one who , waking from a troublous dream ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pursues with force his meditative theme ;</l>
     <l n="3">Calm as the ocean in its halcyon still ,</l>
     <l n="4">Calm as the sunlight sleeping on the hill ;</l>
     <l n="5">Calm as at Ephesus great Paul was seen</l>
     <l n="6">To rend his robes in agonies serene ;</l>
     <l n="7">Calm as the love that radiant Luther bore</l>
     <l n="8">To all that lived behind him and before ;</l>
     <l n="9">Calm as meek Calvin , when , with holy smile ,</l>
     <l n="10">He sang the mass around Servetus ’ pile ,—</l>
     <l n="11">So once again I snatch this harp of mine ,</l>
     <l n="12">To breathe rich incense from a mystic shrine .</l>
     <l n="13">Not now to whisper to the ambient air</l>
     <l n="14">The sounds of Satan 's Universal Prayer ;</l>
     <l n="15">Not now to sing , in sweet domestic strife</l>
     <l n="16">That woman reigns the Angel of our life ;</l>
     <l n="17">But to proclaim the wish , with pious art ,</l>
     <l n="18">Which thrills through Britain 's universal heart ,—</l>
     <l n="19">That on this brow , with native honours graced ,</l>

     <l n="24">Hath this poor heart of mine with frenzy torn .</l>
     <l n="25">There are who move so far above the great ,</l>
     <l n="26">Their very look disarms the glance of hate ;</l>
     <l n="27">Their thoughts , more rich than emerald or gold ,</l>

     <l n="38">And left no page for prophets to reveal ;</l>
     <l n="39">I , who in shade portentous Dante threw ;</l>
     <l n="40">I , who have done what Milton dared not do ,—</l>

    <head>ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PUFF POETICAL</head>
    <list type="illustrations">
     <item>[ The following eleven pieces of verse appeared originally with many others in an article called “ Puffs and Poetry , ” from which the following passage is taken :—</item>
     <item>“ Some people are fond of excursions into the realms of old romance , with their Lancelots and Gueneveres , their enchanted castles , their bearded wizards , ‘ and such odd branches of learning . ’ There needs a winged griffin , at the very least , to carry them out of the everyday six-and-eightpenny world , or the whizz of an Excalibur to startle their drowsy imaginations into life . The beauties and the wonders of the universe died for them some centuries ago ; they went out with Friar Bacon and the invention of gunpowder . Praised be Apollo ! this is not our case . There is a snatch of poetry , to our apprehension , in almost everything . We have detected it pushing its petals forth from the curls of a barrister 's wig , and scented its fragrance even in the columns of the ‘ London Gazette . ’</item>
     <item>“ ‘ The deep poetic voice that hourly speaks within us ’ is never silent . Like Signor Benedick , it ‘ will still be talking . ’ We can scarcely let our eyes dwell upon an object — nay , not even upon a gridiron or a toothpick — but it seems to be transmuted as by the touch of Midas into gold . Our facts accordingly adopt upon occasions a very singular shape . We are not nice to a shade . A trifle here or there never stands in our way . We regard a free play of fancy as the privilege of every genuine Briton , and exclaim with Pistol , ‘ A fico for all yea and nay rogues . ’</item>
     <item>“ We have often thought of entering the lists against Robins [ famous for his imaginative advertisements of properties for sale ] . It may be vanity , but we think we could trump him . Robins amplifies well , but we think we could trump him . There is an obvious effort in his best works . The result is a want of unity of effect . Hesiod and Tennyson , the Caverns of Ellora , and the magic caves of the Regent 's Park Colosseum , are jumbled confusedly one upon another . He never achieves the triumph of art — repose . Besides , he wants variety . A country box , consisting of twenty feet square of tottering brickwork , a plateau of dirt , with a few diseased shrubs and an open drain , is as elaborately be-metaphored as an island of the Hebrides , with a wilderness of red-deer , Celts , ptarmigan , and other wild animals upon it . Now , this is out of all rule . An elephant 's trunk can raise a pin as well as uproot an oak , but it would be ridiculous to employ the same effort for one as for the other . Robins — with reverence to so great a name , be it spoken — does not attend to this . He has yet to acquire the light and graceful touch of the finished artist . ” Thereupon Bon Gaultier proceeds to illustrate his views by the following , and many other rhyming advertisements . ]</item>
     <item>The Death of Ishmael .</item>
     <item>Died the Jew ? “ The Hebrew died . On the pavement cold he lay , Around him closed the living tide ; The butcher 's cad set down his tray ; The pot-boy from the Dragon Green No longer for his pewter calls ; The Nereid rushes in between , Nor more her ‘ Fine live mackerel ! ’ bawls . ”</item>
     <item>Died the Jew ? “ The Hebrew died . They raised him gently from the stone , They flung his coat and neckcloth wide — But linen had that Hebrew none . They raised the pile of hats that pressed His noble head , his locks of snow ; But , ah , that head , upon his breast , Sank down with an expiring ‘ Clo ! ’ ”</item>
     <item>Died the Jew ? “ The Hebrew died , Struck with overwhelming qualms From the flavour spreading wide Of some fine Virginia hams . Would you know the fatal spot , Fatal to that child of sin ? These fine-flavoured hams are bought AT 50 BISHOPSGATE WITHIN ! ”</item>
     <item>Parr 's Life Pills .</item>
     <item>‘ Twas in the town of Lubeck , A hundred years ago , An old man walked into the church , With beard as white as snow ; Yet were his cheeks not wrinkled , Nor dim his eagle eye : There 's many a knight that steps the street , Might wonder , should he chance to meet That man erect and high !</item>
     <item>When silenced was the organ , And hushed the vespers loud , The Sacristan approached the sire , And drew him from the crowd — “ There 's something in thy visage , On which I dare not look ; And when I rang the passing bell , A tremor that I may not tell , My very vitals shook .</item>
     <item>“ Who art thou , awful stranger ? Our ancient annals say , That twice two hundred years ago Another passed this way , Like thee in face and feature ; And , if the tale be true , ‘ Tis writ , that in this very year Again the stranger shall appear . Art thou the Wandering Jew ? ”</item>
     <item>“ The Wandering Jew , thou dotard ! ” The wondrous phantom cried — “ ‘ Tis several centuries ago Since that poor stripling died . He would not use my nostrums — See , shaveling , here they are ! These put to flight all human ills , These conquer death — unfailing pills , And I 'm the inventor , PARR ! ”</item>
     <item>Tarquin and the Augur .</item>
     <item>Gingerly is good King Tarquin shaving . Gently glides the razor o'er his chin , Near him stands a grim Haruspex raving , And with nasal whine he pitches in Church extension hints , Till the monarch squints , Snicks his chin , and swears — a deadly sin !</item>
     <item>“ Jove confound thee , thou bare-legged impostor ! From my dressing-table get thee gone ! Dost thou think my flesh is double Glo'ster ? There again ! That cut was to the bone ! Get ye from my sight ; I 'll believe you 're right , When my razor cuts the sharpening hone ! ”</item>
     <item>Thus spoke Tarquin with a deal of dryness ; But the Augur , eager for his fees , Answered — “ Try it , your Imperial Highness ; Press a little harder , if you please . There ! the deed is done ! ” Through the solid stone Went the steel as glibly as through cheese .</item>
     <item>So the Augur touched the tin of Tarquin , Who suspected some celestial aid ; But he wronged the blameless gods ; for hearken ! Ere the monarch 's bet was rashly laid , With his searching eye Did the priest espy ROGERS ’ name engraved upon the blade .</item>
     <item>La Mort d'Arthur ,</item>
     <item>NOT BY ALFRED TENNYSON .</item>
     <item>Slowly , as one who bears a mortal hurt , Through which the fountain of his life runs dry , Crept good King Arthur down unto the lake . A roughening wind was bringing in the waves With cold dull plash and plunging to the shore , And a great bank of clouds came sailing up Athwart the aspect of the gibbous moon , Leaving no glimpse save starlight , as he sank , With a short stagger , senseless on the stones .</item>
     <item>No man yet knows how long he lay in swound ; But long enough it was to let the rust Lick half the surface of his polished shield ; For it was made by far inferior hands , Than forged his helm , his breastplate , and his greaves , Whereon no canker lighted , for they bore The magic stamp of MECHI 'S SILVER STEEL .</item>
     <item>Jupiter and the Indian Ale .</item>
     <item>“ Take away this clammy nectar ! ” Said the king of gods and men ; “ Never at Olympus ’ table Let that trash be served again . Ho , Lyaeus , thou the beery ! Quick — invent some other drink ; Or , in a brace of shakes , thou standest On Cocytus ’ sulphury brink ! ”</item>
     <item>Terror shook the limbs of Bacchus , Paly grew his pimpled nose , And already in his rearward Felt he Jove 's tremendous toes ; When a bright idea struck him — “ Dash my thyrsus ! I 'll be bail — For you never were in India — That you know not HODGSON 'S ALE ! ”</item>
     <item>“ Bring it ! ” quoth the Cloud-compeller ; And the wine-god brought the beer — “ Port and claret are like water To the noble stuff that 's here ! ” And Saturnius drank and nodded , Winking with his lightning eyes , And amidst the constellations Did the star of HODGSON rise !</item>
     <item>The Lay of the Doudney Brothers .</item>
     <item>Coats at five-and-forty shillings ! trousers ten-and-six a pair ! Summer waistcoats , three a sov'reign , light and comfortable wear ! Taglionis , black or coloured , Chesterfield and velveteen ! The old English shooting-jacket — doeskins such as ne'er were seen ! Army cloaks and riding-habits , Alberts at a trifling cost ! Do you want an annual contract ? Write to DOUDNEYS ’ by the post . DOUDNEY BROTHERS ! DOUDNEY BROTHERS ! Not the men that drive the van , Plastered o'er with advertisements , heralding some paltry plan , How , by base mechanic stinting , and by pinching of their backs , Lean attorneys ’ clerks may manage to retrieve their Income-tax : But the old established business — where the best of clothes are given At the very lowest prices — Fleet Street , Number Ninety-seven . Wouldst thou know the works of DOUDNEY ? Hie thee to the thronged Arcade , To the Park upon a Sunday , to the terrible Parade . There , amid the bayonets bristling , and the flashing of the steel , When the household troops in squadrons round the bold field-marshals wheel , Shouldst thou see an aged warrior in a plain blue morning frock , Peering at the proud battalions o'er the margin of his stock ,— Should thy throbbing heart then tell thee , that the veteran worn and grey Curbed the course of Bonaparte , rolled the thunders of Assaye — Let it tell thee , stranger , likewise , that the goodly garb he wears Started into shape and being from the DOUDNEY BROTHERS ’ shears ! Seek thou next the rooms of Willis — mark , where D'Orsay ' s Count is bending , See the trouser 's undulation from his graceful hip descending ; Hath the earth another trouser so compact and love-compelling ? Thou canst find it , stranger , only , if thou seek'st the DOUDNEYS ’ dwelling ! Hark , from Windsor 's royal palace , what sweet voice enchants the ear ? “ Goodness , what a lovely waistcoat ! Oh , who made it , Albert dear ? ‘ Tis the very prettiest pattern ! You must get a dozen others ! ” And the Prince , in rapture , answers — “ ‘ Tis the work of DOUDNEY BROTHERS ! ”</item>
     <item>Paris and Helen .</item>
     <item>As the youthful Paris presses Helen to his ivory breast . Sporting with her golden tresses , Close and ever closer pressed ,</item>
     <item>“ Let me , ” said he , “ quaff the nectar , Which thy lips of ruby yield ; Glory I can leave to Hector , Gathered in the tented field .</item>
     <item>“ Let me ever gaze upon thee , Look into thine eyes so deep ; With a daring hand I won thee , With a faithful heart I 'll keep .</item>
     <item>“ Oh , my Helen , thou bright wonder , Who was ever like to thee ? Jove would lay aside his thunder , So he might be blest like me .</item>
     <item>“ How mine eyes so fondly linger On thy smooth and pearly skin ; Scan each round and rosy finger , Drinking draughts of beauty in !</item>
     <item>“ Tell me , whence thy beauty , fairest ? Whence thy cheek 's enchanting bloom ? Whence the rosy hue thou wearest ; Breathing round thee rich perfume ? ”</item>
     <item>Thus he spoke , with heart that panted , Clasped her fondly to his side , Gazed on her with look enchanted , While his Helen thus replied :</item>
     <item>“ Be no discord , love , between us , If I not the secret tell ! ‘ Twas a gift I had of Venus ,— Venus , who hath loved me well ;</item>
     <item>“ And she told me as she gave it , ‘ Let not e'er the charm be known ; O'er thy person freely lave it , Only when thou art alone . ’</item>
     <item>“ ‘ Tis enclosed in yonder casket — Here behold its golden key ; But its name — love , do not ask it , Tell't I may not , even to thee ! ”</item>
     <item>Long with vow and kiss he plied her ; Still the secret did she keep , Till at length he sank beside her , Seemed as he had dropped to sleep .</item>
     <item>Soon was Helen laid in slumber , When her Paris , rising slow , Did his fair neck disencumber From her rounded arms of snow .</item>
     <item>Then , her heedless fingers oping , Takes the key and steals away , To the ebon table groping , Where the wondrous casket lay ;</item>
     <item>Eagerly the lid uncloses , Sees within it , laid aslope , PEARS ’ LIQUID BLOOM OF ROSES , Cakes of his TRANSPARENT SOAP !</item>
     <item>A Warning .</item>
     <item>Lose thou no time ! A grave and solemn warning , Yet seldom ta'en , to man 's eternal cost . Night wanes , day lessens , evening , noon , and morning Flit by unseen , and yet much time is lost .</item>
     <item>And why ? Are moments useless as the vapour That rises from the lamp 's extinguish 'd flame ! Why do we , like the moth around the taper , Sport with the fire that must consume our frame ?</item>
     <item>Be wise in time ! Arouse thee , oh thou sleeper , Account thy moments dearer than thy gold ; While time thou hast , appoint a good time-keeper To treasure up thine hours till thou art old .</item>
     <item>Lose but this chance , and thou art lost for ever ,— Seek him who keeps a watch for sinking souls — Ask for COX SAVORY 'S HORIZONTAL LEVER , With double case , and jewell 'd in four holes !</item>
     <item>To Persons About to Marry .</item>
     <item>Gentle pair , ere Hymen binds you In his fetters , soft but sure , Pray , bethink you , have you ever Had substantial furniture ?</item>
     <item>Love 's a fickle god , they tell us , Giddy-pated , lightly led , Therefore it were well you found him In a comfortable bed .</item>
     <item>Olive branches soon will blossom Round your table , two or three ; And that table should be made of Good and strong mahogany .</item>
     <item>If the cares of life should gather , And we all must look for cares ,— Sorrow falls extremely lightly In the midst of rosewood chairs .</item>
     <item>Few that walk can ‘ scape a stumble , Thus hath said The Prophet-King ; But your fall will be a light one On Axminster carpeting .</item>
     <item>We can keep your little children From collision with the grate — We have wardrobes , we have presses At a reasonable rate ;</item>
     <item>Mirrors for the queen of beauty Basins of the purest stone , Ottomans which Cleopatra Might have envied on her throne .</item>
     <item>Seek us ere you taste with rapture Love 's sweet draught of filter 'd honey , And you 'll find the safest plan is , NO DISCOUNT , AND READY MONEY !</item>
     <item>Want Places .</item>
     <item>Wants a place a lad , who 's seen Pious life at brother Teazle 's , Used to cleaning boots , and been Touch 'd with grace , and had the measles .</item>
     <item>Wants a place as housemaid , or Companion to a bachelor , Up in years , and who 'd prefer A person with no character , A female , who in this respect , Would leave him nothing to object .</item>

     <item>[ AIR — “ The days we went a-gypsying . ” ]</item>
     <item>I would all womankind were dead , Or banished o'er the sea ; For they have been a bitter plague These last six weeks to me : It is not that I 'm touched myself , For that I do not fear ; No female face has shown me grace For many a bygone year . But ‘ tis the most infernal bore , Of all the bores I know , To have a friend who 's lost his heart A short time ago .</item>
     <item>Whene'er we steam it to Blackwall , Or down to Greenwich run , To quaff the pleasant cider-cup , And feed on fish and fun ; Or climb the slopes of Richmond Hill , To catch a breath of air : Then , for my sins , he straight begins To rave about his fair . Oh , ‘ tis the most tremendous bore , Of all the bores I know , To have a friend who 's lost his heart A short time ago .</item>
     <item>In vain you pour into his ear Your own confiding grief ; In vain you claim his sympathy , In vain you ask relief ; In vain you try to rouse him by Joke , repartee , or quiz ; His sole reply 's a burning sigh , And “ What a mind it is ! ” O Lord ! it is the greatest bore , Of all the bores I know , To have a friend who 's lost his heart A short time ago .</item>
     <item>I 've heard her thoroughly described A hundred times , I 'm sure ; And all the while I 've tried to smile , And patiently endure ; He waxes strong upon his pangs , And potters o'er his grog ; And still I say , in a playful way — “ Why , you 're a lucky dog ! ” But oh ! it is the heaviest bore , Of all the bores I know , To have a friend who 's lost his heart A short time ago .</item>
     <item>I really wish he 'd do like me , When I was young and strong ; I formed a passion every week , But never kept it long . But he has not the sportive mood That always rescued me , And so I would all women could Be banished o'er the sea . For ‘ tis the most egregious bore , Of all the bores I know , To have a friend who 's lost his heart A short time ago .</item>

    <p>TO BON GAULTIER . [ ARGUMENT .— An impassioned pupil of Leigh Hunt , having met Bon Gaultier at a Fancy Ball , declares the destructive consequences thus . ] Didst thou not praise me , Gaultier , at the ball , Ripe lips , trim boddice , and a waist so small , With clipsome lightness , dwindling ever less , Beneath the robe of pea-y greeniness ? Dost thou remember , when , with stately prance , Our heads went crosswise in the country-dance ; How soft , warm fingers , tipped like buds of balm , Trembled within the squeezing of thy palm ; And how a cheek grew flushed and peachy-wise At the frank lifting of thy cordial eyes ? Ah , me ! that night there was one gentle thing , Who , like a dove , with its scarce feathered wing , Fluttered at the approach of thy quaint swaggering ! There 's wont to be , at conscious times like these , An affectation of a bright-eyed ease ,— A crispy cheekiness , if so I dare Describe the swaling of a jaunty air ; And thus , when swirling from the waltz 's wheel , You craved my hand to grace the next quadrille , That smiling voice , although it made me start , Boiled in the meek o'erlifting of my heart ; And , picking at my flowers , I said , with free And usual tone , “ O yes , sir , certainly ! ” Like one that swoons , ‘ twixt sweet amaze and fear , I heard the music burning in my ear , And felt I cared not , so thou wert with me , If Gurth or Wamba were our vis-a-vis . So , when a tall Knight Templar ringing came , And took his place amongst us with his dame , I neither turned away , nor bashful shrunk From the stern survey of the soldier-monk , Though rather more than three full quarters drunk ; But , threading through the figure , first in rule , I paused to see thee plunge into La Poule . Ah , what a sight was that ! Not prurient Mars , Pointing his toe through ten celestial bars — Not young Apollo , beamily arrayed In tripsome guise for Juno 's masquerade — Not smartest Hermes , with his pinion girth , Jerking with freaks and snatches down to earth , Looked half so bold , so beautiful , and strong , As thou , when pranking through the glittering throng ! How the calmed ladies looked with eyes of love On thy trim velvet doublet laced above ; The hem of gold , that , like a wavy river , Flowed down into thy back with glancing shiver ! So bare was thy fine throat , and curls of black , So lightsomely dropped in thy lordly back , So crisply swaled the feather in thy bonnet , So glanced thy thigh , and spanning palm upon it , That my weak soul took instant flight to thee , Lost in the fondest gush of that sweet witchery ! But when the dance was o'er , and arm in arm ( The full heart beating ‘ gainst the elbow warm ) We passed into the great refreshment-hall , Where the heaped cheese-cakes and the comfits small Lay , like a hive of sunbeams , brought to burn Around the margin of the negus urn ; When my poor quivering hand you fingered twice , And , with inquiring accents , whispered “ Ice , Water , or cream ? ” I could no more dissemble , But dropped upon the couch all in a tremble . A swimming faintness misted o'er my brain , The corks seemed starting from the brisk champagne , The custards fell untouched upon the floor , Thine eyes met mine . That night we danced no more ! The Cadi 's Daughter . A LEGEND OF THE BOSPHORUS . [ FROM ANY OF THE ANNUALS . ] How beauteous is the star of night Within the eastern skies , Like the twinkling glance of the Toorkman 's lance , Or the antelope 's azure eyes ! A lamp of love in the heaven above , That star is fondly streaming ; And the gay kiosk and the shadowy mosque In the Golden Horn are gleaming . Young Leila sits in her jasmine bower , And she hears the bulbul sing , As it thrills its throat to the first full note , That anthems the flowery spring . She gazes still , as a maiden will , On that beauteous eastern star : You might see the throb of her bosom 's sob Beneath the white cymar ! She thinks of him who is far away ,— Her own brave Galiongee ,— Where the billows foam and the breezes roam , On the wild Carpathian sea . She thinks of the oath that bound them both Beside the stormy water ; And the words of love , that in Athens ’ grove He spake to the Cadi 's daughter . “ My Selim ! ” thus the maiden said , “ Though severed thus we be By the raging deep and the mountain steep , My soul still yearns to thee . Thy form so dear is mirrored here In my heart 's pellucid well , As the rose looks up to Phingari 's orb , Or the moth to the gay gazelle . “ I think of the time when the Kaftan 's crime Our love 's young joys o'ertook , And thy name still floats in the plaintive notes Of my silver-toned chibouque . Thy hand is red with the blood it has shed , Thy soul it is heavy laden ; Yet come , my Giaour , to thy Leila 's bower ; Oh , come to thy Turkish maiden ! ” A light step trod on the dewy sod , And a voice was in her ear , And an arm embraced young Leila 's waist — “ Beloved ! I am here ! ” Like the phantom form that rules the storm , Appeared the pirate lover , And his fiery eye was like Zatanai , As he fondly bent above her . “ Speak , Leila , speak ; for my light caique Rides proudly in yonder bay ; I have come from my rest to her I love best , To carry thee , love , away . The breast of thy lover shall shield thee , and cover My own jemscheed from harm ; Think'st thou I fear the dark vizier , Or the mufti 's vengeful arm ? “ Then droop not , love , nor turn away From this rude hand of mine ! ” And Leila looked in her lover 's eyes , And murmured — “ I am thine ! ” But a gloomy man with a yataghan . Stole through the acacia-blossoms , And the thrust he made with his gleaming blade Hath pierced through both their bosoms . “ There ! there ! thou cursed caitiff Giaour ! There , there , thou false one , lie ! ” Remorseless Hassan stands above , And he smiles to see them die . They sleep beneath the fresh green turf , The lover and the lady — And the maidens wail to hear the tale Of the daughter of the Cadi ! The Dirge of the Drinker . Brothers , spare awhile your liquor , lay your final tumbler down ; He has dropped — that star of honour — on the field of his renown ! Raise the wail , but raise it softly , lowly bending on your knees , If you find it more convenient , you may hiccup if you please . Sons of Pantagruel , gently let your hip-hurrahing sink , Be your manly accents clouded , half with sorrow , half with drink ! Lightly to the sofa pillow lift his head from off the floor ; See , how calm he sleeps , unconscious as the deadest nail in door ! Widely o'er the earth I 've wandered ; where the drink most freely flowed , I have ever reeled the foremost , foremost to the beaker strode . Deep in shady Cider Cellars I have dreamed o'er heavy wet , By the fountains of Damascus I have quaffed the rich sherbet , Regal Montepulciano drained beneath its native rock , On Johannis ’ sunny mountain frequent hiccuped o'er my hock ; I have bathed in butts of Xeres deeper than did e'er Monsoon , Sangaree 'd with bearded Tartars in the Mountains of the Moon ; In beer-swilling Copenhagen I have drunk your Danesman blind , I have kept my feet in Jena , when each bursch to earth declined ; Glass for glass , in fierce Jamaica , I have shared the planter 's rum . Drunk with Highland dhuine-wassails , till each gibbering Gael grew dumb ; But a stouter , bolder drinker — one that loved his liquor more — Never yet did I encounter than our friend upon the floor ! Yet the best of us are mortal , we to weakness all are heir , He has fallen who rarely staggered — let the rest of us beware ! We shall leave him as we found him ,— lying where his manhood fell , ‘ Mong the trophies of the revel , for he took his tipple well . Better ‘ twere we loosed his neckcloth , laid his throat and bosom bare , Pulled his Hobies off , and turned his toes to taste the breezy air . Throw the sofa cover o'er him , dim the flaring of the gas , Calmly , calmly let him slumber , and , as by the bar we pass , We shall bid that thoughtful waiter place beside him , near and handy , Large supplies of soda-water , tumblers bottomed well with brandy , So , when waking , he shall drain them , with that deathless thirst of his ,— Clinging to the hand that smote him , like a good ‘ un as he is ! The Death of Duval . BY W — -  H — -  A — - TH , ESQ . [ “ Methinks I see him already in the cart , sweeter and more lovely than the nosegay in his hand ! I hear the crowd extolling his resolution and intrepidity ! What volleys of sighs are sent from the windows of Holborn , that so comely a youth should be brought to disgrace ! I see him at the tree ! the whole circle are in tears ! even butchers weep ! ” — BEGGARS OPERA . ] A living sea of eager human faces , A thousand bosoms throbbing all as one , Walls , windows , balconies , all sorts of places , Holding their crowds of gazers to the sun : Through the hushed groups low-buzzing murmurs run ; And on the air , with slow reluctant swell , Comes the dull funeral-boom of old Sepulchre 's bell . Oh , joy in London now ! in festal measure Be spent the evening of this festive day ! For thee is opening now a high-strung pleasure ; Now , even now , in yonder press-yard they Strike from his limbs the fetters loose away ! A little while , and he , the brave Duval , Will issue forth , serene , to glad and greet you all . “ Why comes he not ? Say , wherefore doth he tarry ? ” Starts the inquiry loud from every tongue . “ Surely , ” they cry , “ that tedious Ordinary His tedious psalms must long ere this have sung ,— Tedious to him that 's waiting to be hung ! ” But hark ! old Newgate 's doors fly wide apart . “ He comes , he comes ! ” A thrill shoots through each gazer 's heart . Joined in the stunning cry ten thousand voices , All Smithfield answered to the loud acclaim . “ He comes , he comes ! ” and every breast rejoices , As down Snow Hill the shout tumultuous came , Bearing to Holborn 's crowd the welcome fame . “ He comes , he comes ! ” and each holds back his breath — Some ribs are broke , and some few scores are crushed to death . With step majestic to the cart advances The dauntless Claude , and springs into his seat . He feels that on him now are fixed the glances Of many a Briton bold and maiden sweet , Whose hearts responsive to his glories beat . In him the honour of “ The Road ” is centred , And all the hero 's fire into his bosom entered . His was the transport — his the exultation Of Rome 's great generals , when from afar , Up to the Capitol , in the ovation , They bore with them , in the triumphal car , Rich gold and gems , the spoils of foreign war . Io Triumphe ! They forgot their clay . E'en so Duval , who rode in glory on his way . His laced cravat , his kids of purest yellow , The many-tinted nosegay in his hand , His large black eyes , so fiery , yet so mellow , Like the old vintages of Spanish land , Locks clustering o'er a brow of high command , Subdue all hearts ; and , as up Holborn 's steep Toils the slow car of death , e'en cruel butchers weep . He saw it , but he heeded not . His story , He knew , was graven on the page of Time . Tyburn to him was as a field of glory , Where he must stoop to death his head sublime , Hymned in full many an elegiac rhyme . He left his deeds behind him , and his name — For he , like Caesar , had lived long enough for fame . He quailed not , save when , as he raised the chalice ,— St Giles 's bowl ,— filled with the mildest ale , To pledge the crowd , on her — his beauteous Alice — His eye alighted , and his cheek grew pale . She , whose sweet breath was like the spicy gale , She , whom he fondly deemed his own dear girl , Stood with a tall dragoon , drinking long draughts of purl . He bit his lip — it quivered but a moment — Then passed his hand across his flushing brows : He could have spared so forcible a comment Upon the constancy of woman 's vows . One short sharp pang his hero-soul allows ; But in the bowl he drowned the stinging pain , And on his pilgrim course went calmly forth again . A princely group of England 's noble daughters Stood in a balcony suffused with grief , Diffusing fragrance round them , of strong waters , And waving many a snowy handkerchief ; Then glowed the prince of highwayman and thief ! His soul was touched with a seraphic gleam — That woman could be false was but a mocking dream . And now , his bright career of triumph ended , His chariot stood beneath the triple tree . The law 's grim finisher to its boughs ascended , And fixed the hempen bandages , while he Bowed to the throng , then bade the cart go free . The car rolled on , and left him dangling there , Like famed Mohammed 's tomb , uphung midway in air . As droops the cup of the surcharged lily Beneath the buffets of the surly storm , Or the soft petals of the daffodilly , When Sirius is uncomfortably warm , So drooped his head upon his manly form , While floated in the breeze his tresses brown . He hung the stated time , and then they cut him down . With soft and tender care the trainbands bore him , Just as they found him , nightcap , robe , and all , And placed this neat though plain inscription o'er him , Among the atomies in Surgeons ’ Hall : “ THESE ARE THE BONES OF THE RENOWNED DUVAL ! ” There still they tell us , from their glassy case , He was the last , the best of all that noble race ! Eastern Serenade . BY THE HONOURABLE SINJIN MUFF . The minarets wave on the plain of Stamboul , And the breeze of the evening blows freshly and cool ; The voice of the musnud is heard from the west , And kaftan and kalpac have gone to their rest . The notes of the kislar re-echo no more , And the waves of Al Sirat fall light on the shore . Where art thou , my beauty ; where art thou , my bride ? Oh , come and repose by thy dragoman 's side ! I wait for thee still by the flowery tophaik — I have broken my Eblis for Zuleima 's sake . But the heart that adores thee is faithful and true , Though it beats ‘ neath the folds of a Greek Allah-hu ! Oh , wake thee , my dearest ! the muftis are still , And the tschocadars sleep on the Franguestan hill ; No sullen aleikoum — no derveesh is here , And the mosques are all watching by lonely Kashmere ! Oh , come in the gush of thy beauty so full , I have waited for thee , my adored attar-gul ! I see thee — I hear thee — thy antelope foot Treads lightly and soft on the velvet cheroot ; The jewelled amaun of thy zemzem is bare , And the folds of thy palampore wave in the air . Come , rest on the bosom that loves thee so well , My dove ! my phingari ! my gentle gazelle ! Nay , tremble not , dearest ! I feel thy heart throb , ‘ Neath the sheltering shroud of thy snowy kiebaub ; Lo , there shines Muezzin , the beautiful star ! Thy lover is with thee , and danger afar : Say , is it the glance of the haughty vizier , Or the bark of the distant effendi , you fear ? Oh , swift fly the hours in the garden of bliss ! And sweeter than balm of Gehenna thy kiss ! Wherever I wander — wherever I roam , My spirit flies back to its beautiful home ; It dwells by the lake of the limpid Stamboul , With thee , my adored one ! my own attar-gul ! { 269 } Dame Fredegonde . When folks , with headstrong passion blind , To play the fool make up their mind , They 're sure to come with phrases nice And modest air , for your advice . But as a truth unfailing make it , They ask , but never mean to take it . ‘ Tis not advice they want , in fact , But confirmation in their act . Now mark what did , in such a case , A worthy priest who knew the race . A dame more buxom , blithe , and free , Than Fredegonde you scarce would see . So smart her dress , so trim her shape , Ne'er hostess offered juice of grape , Could for her trade wish better sign ; Her looks gave flavour to her wine , And each guest feels it , as he sips , Smack of the ruby of her lips . A smile for all , a welcome glad ,— A jovial coaxing way she had ; And ,— what was more her fate than blame ,— A nine months ’ widow was our dame . But toil was hard , for trade was good , And gallants sometimes will be rude . “ And what can a lone woman do ? The nights are long and eerie too . Now , Guillot there 's a likely man , None better draws or taps a can ; He 's just the man , I think , to suit , If I could bring my courage to't . ” With thoughts like these her mind is crossed : The dame , they say , who doubts , is lost . “ But then the risk ? I 'll beg a slice Of Father Haulin 's good advice . ” Prankt in her best , with looks demure , She seeks the priest ; and , to be sure , Asks if he thinks she ought to wed : “ With such a business on my head , I 'm worried off my legs with care , And need some help to keep things square . I 've thought of Guillot , truth to tell ! He 's steady , knows his business well . What do you think ? ” When thus he met her : “ Oh , take him , dear , you can n't do better ! ” “ But then the danger , my good pastor , If of the man I make the master . There is no trusting to these men . ” “ Well , well , my dear , do n't have him , then ! ” “ But help I must have ; there 's the curse . I may go farther and fare worse . ” “ Why , take him , then ! ” “ But if he should Turn out a thankless ne'erhYpppHeNdohYpppHeNgood — In drink and riot waste my all , And rout me out of house and hall ? ” “ Do n't have him , then ! But I 've a plan To clear your doubts , if any can . The bells a peal are ringing ,— hark ! Go straight , and what they tell you mark . If they say ‘ Yes ! ’ wed , and be blest — If ‘ No , ’ why — do as you think best . ” The bells rang out a triple bob : Oh , how our widow 's heart did throb , As thus she heard their burden go , “ Marry , mar-marry , mar-Guillot ! ” Bells were not then left to hang idle : A week ,— and they rang for her bridal . But , woe the while , they might as well Have rung the poor dame 's parting knell . The rosy dimples left her cheek , She lost her beauties plump and sleek ; For Guillot oftener kicked than kissed , And backed his orders with his fist , Proving by deeds as well as words That servants make the worst of lords . She seeks the priest , her ire to wreak , And speaks as angry women speak , With tiger looks and bosom swelling , Cursing the hour she took his telling . To all , his calm reply was this ,— “ I fear you 've read the bells amiss : If they have lead you wrong in aught , Your wish , not they , inspired the thought . Just go , and mark well what they say . ” Off trudged the dame upon her way , And sure enough their chime went so ,— “ Do n't have that knave , that knave Guillot ! ” “ Too true , ” she cried , “ there 's not a doubt : What could my ears have been about ? ” She had forgot , that , as fools think , The bell is ever sure to clink . Song of the Ennuye . I 'm weary , and sick , and disgusted With Britain 's mechanical din ; Where I 'm much too well known to be trusted , And plaguily pestered for tin ; Where love has two eyes for your banker , And one chilly glance for yourself ; Where souls can afford to be franker , But when they 're well garnished with pelf . I 'm sick of the whole race of poets , Emasculate , misty , and fine ; They brew their small-beer , and do n't know its Distinction from full-bodied wine . I 'm sick of the prosers , that house up At drowsy St Stephen 's ,— ai n't you ? I want some strong spirits to rouse up A good revolution or two ! I 'm sick of a land , where each morrow Repeats the dull tale of to-day , Where you can n't even find a new sorrow To chase your stale pleasures away . I 'm sick of blue-stockings horrific , Steam , railroads , gas , scrip , and consols ; So I 'll off where the golden Pacific Round Islands of Paradise rolls . There the passions shall revel unfettered , And the heart never speak but in truth , And the intellect , wholly unlettered , Be bright with the freedom of youth ! There the earth can rejoice in her blossoms , Unsullied by vapour or soot , And there chimpanzees and opossums Shall playfully pelt me with fruit . There I 'll sit with my dark Orianas , In groves by the murmuring sea , And they 'll give , as I suck the bananas , Their kisses , nor ask them from me . They 'll never torment me for sonnets , Nor bore me to death with their own ; They 'll ask not for shawls nor for bonnets , For milliners there are unknown . There my couch shall be earth 's freshest flowers , My curtains the night and the stars , And my spirit shall gather new powers , Uncramped by conventional bars . Love for love , truth for truth ever giving , My days shall be manfully sped ; I shall know that I 'm loved while I 'm living , And be wept by fond eyes when I 'm dead ! The Death of Space . [ Why has Satan 's own Laureate never given to the world his marvellous threnody on the “ Death of Space ” ? Who knows where the bays might have fallen , had he forwarded that mystic manuscript to the Home Office ? If unwonted modesty withholds it from the public eye , the public will pardon the boldness that tears from blushing obscurity the following fragments of this unique poem . ] Eternity shall raise her funeral-pile In the vast dungeon of the extinguished sky , And , clothed in dim barbaric splendour , smile , And murmur shouts of elegiac joy . While those that dwell beyond the realms of space , And those that people all that dreary void , When old Time 's endless heir hath run his race , Shall live for aye , enjoying and enjoyed . And ‘ mid the agony of unsullied bliss , Her Demogorgon 's doom shall Sin bewail , The undying serpent at the spheres shall hiss , And lash the empyrean with his tail . And Hell , inflated with supernal wrath , Shall open wide her thunder-bolted jaws , And shout into the dull cold ear of Death , That he must pay his debt to Nature 's laws . And when the King of Terrors breathes his last , Infinity shall creep into her shell , Cause and effect shall from their thrones be cast , And end their strife with suicidal yell : While from their ashes , burnt with pomp of kings , ‘ Mid incense floating to the evanished skies , Nonenity , on circumambient wings , An everlasting Phoenix shall arise . Caroline . Lightsome , brightsome , cousin mine , Easy , breezy Caroline ! With thy locks all raven-shaded , From thy merry brow up-braided , And thine eyes of laughter full , Brightsome cousin mine ! Thou in chains of love hast bound me — Wherefore dost thou flit around me , Laughter-loving Caroline ? When I fain would go to sleep In my easy-chair , Wherefore on my slumbers creep — Wherefore start me from repose , Tickling of my hooked nose , Pulling of my hair ? Wherefore , then , if thou dost love me , So to words of anger move me , Corking of this face of mine , Tricksy cousin Caroline ? When a sudden sound I hear , Much my nervous system suffers , Shaking through and through . Cousin Caroline , I fear , ‘ Twas no other , now , but you , Put gunpowder in the snuffers , Springing such a mine ! Yes , it was your tricksy self , Wicked-tricked little elf , Naughty Caroline ! Pins she sticks into my shoulder , Places needles in my chair , And , when I begin to scold her , Tosses back her combed hair , With so saucy-vexed an air , That the pitying beholder Cannot brook that I should scold her : Then again she comes , and bolder , Blacks anew this face of mine , Artful cousin Caroline ! Would she only say she 'd love me , Winsome , tinsome Caroline , Unto such excess ‘ twould move me , Teazing , pleasing , cousin mine ! That she might the live-long day Undermine the snuffer-tray , Tickle still my hooked nose , Startle me from calm repose With her pretty persecution ; Throw the tongs against my shins , Run me through and through with pins , Like a pierced cushion ; Would she only say she 'd love me , Darning-needles should not move me ; But , reclining back , I 'd say , “ Dearest ! there 's the snuffer-tray ; Pinch , O pinch those legs of mine ! Cork me , cousin Caroline ! ” To a Forget-Me-Not , FOUND IN MY EMPORIUM OF LOVE-TOKENS . Sweet flower , that with thy soft blue eye Didst once look up in shady spot , To whisper to the passer-by Those tender words — Forget-me-not ! Though withered now , thou art to me The minister of gentle thought ,— And I could weep to gaze on thee , Love 's faded pledge — Forget-me-not ! Thou speak'st of hours when I was young , And happiness arose unsought ; When she , the whispering woods among , Gave me thy bloom — Forget-me-not ! That rapturous hour with that dear maid From memory 's page no time shall blot , When , yielding to my kiss , she said , “ Oh , Theodore — Forget me not ! ” Alas for love ! alas for truth ! Alas for man 's uncertain lot ! Alas for all the hopes of youth That fade like thee — Forget-me-not ! Alas for that one image fair , With all my brightest dreams inwrought ! That walks beside me everywhere , Still whispering — Forget-me-not ! Oh , Memory ! thou art but a sigh For friendships dead and loves forgot , And many a cold and altered eye That once did say — Forget-me-not ! And I must bow me to thy laws , For — odd although it may be thought — I can n't tell who the deuce it was That gave me this Forget-me-not ! The Meeting . Once I lay beside a fountain , Lulled me with its gentle song , And my thoughts o'er dale and mountain With the clouds were borne along . There I saw old castles flinging Shadowy gleams on moveless seas , Saw gigantic forests swinging To and fro without a breeze ; And in dusky alleys straying , Many a giant shape of power , Troops of nymphs in sunshine playing , Singing , dancing , hour on hour . I , too , trod these plains Elysian , Heard their ringing tones of mirth , But a brighter , fairer vision Called me back again to earth . From the forest shade advancing , See , where comes a lovely May ; The dew , like gems , before her glancing , As she brushes it away ! Straight I rose , and ran to meet her , Seized her hand — the heavenly blue Of her eyes smiled brighter , sweeter , As she asked me — “ Who are you ? ” To that question came another — What its aim I still must doubt — And she asked me , “ How 's your mother ? Does she know that you are out ? ” “ No ! my mother does not know it , Beauteous , heaven-descended muse ! ” “ Then be off , my handsome poet , And say I sent you with the news ! ” The Mishap . “ Why art thou weeping , sister ? Why is thy cheek so pale ? Look up , dear Jane , and tell me What is it thou dost ail ? “ I know thy will is froward , Thy feelings warm and keen , And that that Augustus Howard For weeks has not been seen . “ I know how much you loved him ; But I know thou dost not weep For him ;— for though his passion be , His purse is noways deep . “ Then tell me why those tear-drops ? What means this woeful mood Say , has the tax-collector Been calling , and been rude ? “ Or has that hateful grocer , The slave ! been here to-day ? Of course he had , by morrow 's noon , A heavy bill to pay ! “ Come , on thy brother 's bosom Unburden all thy woes ; Look up , look up , sweet sister ; Nay , sob not through thy nose . ” “ Oh , John , ‘ tis not the grocer Or his account , although How ever he is to be paid I really do not know . “ ‘ Tis not the tax-collector ; Though by his fell command They 've seized our old paternal clock , And new umbrella-stand ! “ Nor that Augustus Howard , Whom I despise almost ,— But the soot 's come down the chimney , John , And fairly spoilt the roast ! ” Comfort in Affliction . “ Wherefore starts my bosom 's lord ? Why this anguish in thine eye ? Oh , it seems as thy heart 's chord Had broken with that sigh ! “ Rest thee , my dear lord , I pray , Rest thee on my bosom now ! And let me wipe the dews away , Are gathering on thy brow . “ There , again ! that fevered start ! What , love ! husband ! is thy pain ? There is a sorrow on thy heart , A weight upon thy brain ! “ Nay , nay , that sickly smile can ne'er Deceive affection 's searching eye ; ‘ Tis a wife 's duty , love , to share Her husband 's agony . “ Since the dawn began to peep , Have I lain with stifled breath ; Heard thee moaning in thy sleep , As thou wert at grips with death . “ Oh , what joy it was to see My gentle lord once more awake ! Tell me , what is amiss with thee ? Speak , or my heart will break ! ” “ Mary , thou angel of my life , Thou ever good and kind ; ‘ Tis not , believe me , my dear wife , The anguish of the mind ! “ It is not in my bosom , dear , No , nor my brain , in sooth ; But Mary , oh , I feel it here , Here in my wisdom tooth ! “ Then give ,— oh , first best antidote ,— Sweet partner of my bed ! Give me thy flannel petticoat To wrap around my head ! ” The Invocation . “ Brother , thou art very weary , And thine eye is sunk and dim , And thy neckcloth 's tie is crumpled , And thy collar out of trim ; There is dust upon thy visage ,— Think not , Charles , I would hurt ye , When I say , that altogether You appear extremely dirty . “ Frown not , brother , now , but hie thee To thy chamber 's distant room ; Drown the odours of the ledger With the lavender 's perfume . Brush the mud from off thy trousers , O'er the china basin kneel , Lave thy brows in water softened With the soap of Old Castile . “ Smooth the locks that o'er thy forehead Now in loose disorder stray ; Pare thy nails , and from thy whiskers Cut those ragged points away ; Let no more thy calculations Thy bewildered brain beset ; Life has other hopes than Cocker 's , Other joys than tare and tret . “ Haste thee , for I ordered dinner , Waiting to the very last , Twenty minutes after seven , And ‘ tis now the quarter past . ‘ Tis a dinner which Lucullus Would have wept with joy to see , One , might wake the soul of Curtis From death 's drowsy atrophy . “ There is soup of real turtle , Turbot , and the dainty sole ; And the mottled roe of lobsters Blushes through the butter-bowl . There the lordly haunch of mutton , Tender as the mountain grass , Waits to mix its ruddy juices With the girdling caper-sauce . “ There a stag , whose branching forehead Spoke him monarch of the herds , He whose flight was o'er the heather Swift as through the air the bird 's , Yields for thee a dish of cutlets ; And the haunch that wont to dash O'er the roaring mountain-torrent , Smokes in most delicious hash . “ There , besides , are amber jellies Floating like a golden dream ; Ginger from the far Bermudas , Dishes of Italian cream ; And a princely apple-dumpling , Which my own fair fingers wrought , Shall unfold its nectared treasures To thy lips all smoking hot . “ Ha ! I see thy brow is clearing , Lustre flashes from thine eyes ; To thy lips I see the moisture Of anticipation rise . Hark ! the dinner-bell is sounding ! ” “ Only wait one moment , Jane : I 'll be dressed , and down , before you Can get up the iced champagne ! ” The Husband 's Petition . Come hither , my heart 's darling , Come , sit upon my knee , And listen , while I whisper A boon I ask of thee . You need not pull my whiskers So amorously , my dove ; ‘ Tis something quite apart from The gentle cares of love . I feel a bitter craving — A dark and deep desire , That glows beneath my bosom Like coals of kindled fire . The passion of the nightingale , When singing to the rose , Is feebler than the agony That murders my repose ! Nay , dearest ! do not doubt me , Though madly thus I speak — I feel thy arms about me , Thy tresses on my cheek : I know the sweet devotion That links thy heart with mine ,— I know my soul 's emotion Is doubly felt by thine : And deem not that a shadow Hath fallen across my love : No , sweet , my love is shadowless , As yonder heaven above : These little taper fingers — Ah , Jane ! how white they be !— Can well supply the cruel want That almost maddens me . Thou wilt not sure deny me My first and fond request ; I pray thee , by the memory Of all we cherish best — By all the dear remembrance Of those delicious days , When , hand in hand , we wandered Along the summer braes ; By all we felt , unspoken , When ‘ neath the early moon , We sat beside the rivulet , In the leafy month of June ; And by the broken whisper That fell upon my ear , More sweet than angel music , When first I wooed thee , dear ! By thy great vow which bound thee For ever to my side , And by the ring that made thee My darling and my bride ! Thou wilt not fail nor falter , But bend thee to the task — A BOILED SHEEP'ShYpppHeNHEAD ON SUNDAY Is all the boon I ask ! Sonnet to Britain . BY THE D — -  OF W — -  Halt ! Shoulder arms ! Recover ! As you were ! Right wheel ! Eyes left ! Attention ! Stand at ease ! O Britain ! O my country ! Words like these Have made thy name a terror and a fear To all the nations . Witness Ebro 's banks , Assaye , Toulouse , Nivelle , and Waterloo , Where the grim despot muttered — Sauve qui peut ! And Ney fled darkling .— Silence in the ranks ! Inspired by these , amidst the iron crash Of armies , in the centre of his troop The soldier stands — unmoveable , not rash — Until the forces of the foeman droop ; Then knocks the Frenchmen to eternal smash , Pounding them into mummy . Shoulder , hoop !</p>

    <p n="7">{ 18 } The allusion here is to one of Ducrow 's remarkable feats . Entering the ring with the reins in his hands of five horses abreast , and standing on the back of the centre horse , he worked them round the ring at high speed , changing now and then with marvellous dexterity their relative positions , and with his feet always on more than one of them , ending with a foot on each of the extreme two , so that , as described , “ the outer and the inner felt the pressure of his toes . ”</p>

    <p n="13">{ 117 } The reference here and in a subsequent verse is to a song very popular at the time :—</p>
    <p n="14">“ All round my hat I vears a green villow , All round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day , And if any van should arsk you the reason vy I vears it , Say , all for my true love that 's far , far away . ‘ Twas agoin of my rounds on the streets I first did meet her , ‘ Twas agoin of my rounds that first she met my heye , And I never heard a voice more louder nor more sweeter , As she cried , ‘ Who 'll buy my cabbages , my cabbages who 'll buy ? ’ ”</p>
    <p n="15">There were several more verses , and being set to a very taking air , it was a reigning favourite with the “ Social Chucksters ” of the day . Even scholars thought it worth turning into Latin verse . I remember reading in some short-lived journal a very clever version of it , the first verse of which ran thus —</p>
    <p n="16">“ Omne circa petusum sertum gero viridem Per annum circa petasum et unum diem plus . Si quis te rogaret , cur tale sertum gererem , Dic , ‘ Omne propter corculum qui est inpartibus . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="17">Allusions to the willow , as an emblem of grief , are of a very old date . “ Sing all , a green willow must be my garland , ” is the refrain of the song which haunted Desdemona on the eve of her death ( Othello , act iv . sc . 3 ) . That exquisite scene , and the beautiful air to which some contemporary of Shakespeare wedded it , will make “ The Willow Song ” immortal .</p>
    <p n="18">{ 119a } { 119b } Madame Laffarge and Daniel Good were the two most talked about criminals of the time when these lines were written . Madame Laffarge was convicted of poisoning her husband under extenuating circumstances , and was imprisoned for life , but many believed in her protestations of innocence — this , of course , she being a woman and unhappily married . Daniel Good died on the scaffold on the 23rd of May 1842 , protesting his innocence to the last , and asserting that his victim , Jane Sparks , had killed herself , an assertion which a judge and jury naturally could not reconcile with the fact that her head , arms , and legs had been cut off and hidden with her body in a stable . He , too , found people to maintain that his sentence was unjust .</p>
    <p n="19">{ 121 } The two papers here glanced at were ‘ The Age ’ and ‘ The Satirist , ’ long since dead .</p>
    <p n="20">{ 122a } The colonnaded portion of Regent Street , immediately above the Regent Circus , was then called the Quadrant . Being sheltered from the weather , it was a favourite promenade , but became so favourite a resort of the “ larking ” population — male and female — that the Colonnade was removed in the interests of social order and decorum .</p>
    <p n="21">{ 122b } The expression of contemptuous defiance , signified by the application of the thumb of one hand to the nose , spreading out the fingers , and attaching to the little finger the stretched-out fingers of the other hand , and working them in a circle . Among the graffiti in Pompeii are examples of the same subtle symbolism .</p>
    <p n="22">{ 122c } Well known to readers of Thackeray 's ‘ Newcomes ’ as “ The Cave of Harmony . ”</p>
    <p n="23">{ 123 } Sir Peter Laurie , Lord Mayor ; afterwards Alderman , and notable for his sagacity and severity as a magistrate in dealing with evil-doers .</p>
    <p n="24">{ 157 } Sir James Graham was then , and had been for some years , Secretary Of State under Sir Robert Peel .</p>
    <p n="25">{ 160 } Moxon was Tennyson 's publisher .</p>
    <p n="26">{ 162 } Edward Fitzball , besides being the prolific author of the most sulphurous and sanguinary melodramas , flirted also with the Muses . His triumph in this line was the ballad , “ My Jane , my Jane , my pretty Jane , ” who was for many long years implored in the delightful tenor notes of Sims Reeves “ never to look so shy , and to meet him , meet him in the evening when the bloom was on the rye . ” Fitzball , I have heard , was the meekest and least bellicose of men , and this was probably the reason why he was dubbed by Bon Gaultier “ the terrible Fitzball . ”</p>

    <p n="29">{ 200 } Lord John Russell 's vehement letter on Papal Aggression in November 1850 to the Bishop of Durham , provoked by the Papal Bull creating Catholic bishops in England , and the angry controversy to which it led , were followed by the passing of the Ecclesiastic Titles Bill in 1857 . Aytoun was not alone in thinking that Cardinal Wiseman , the first to act upon the mandate from Rome , was more than a match for Lord John , and that the Bill would become a dead letter , as it did . The controversy was at its hottest when Aytoun expressed his view of the probable result of the conflict in the preceding ballad .</p>
    <p n="30">{ 269 } This poem appeared in a review by Bon Gaultier of an imaginary volume , ‘ The Poets of the Day , ’ and was in ridicule of the numerous verses of the time , to which the use of Turkish words was supposed to impart a poetical flavour . His reviewer 's comment upon it was as follows :—</p>
    <p n="31">“ Had Byron been alive , or Moore not ceased to write , we should have bidden them look to their laurels . ‘ Nonsense , ’ says Dryden , ‘ shall be eloquent in love , ’ and here we find the axiom aptly illustrated , for in this Eastern Serenade are comprised nonsense and eloquence in perfection . But , apart from its erotic and poetical merits , it is a great curiosity , as exhibiting in a very marked manner the singular changes which the stride of civilisation and the bow-string of the Sultan Mahmoud have made in the Turkish language and customs within a very few years . Thus we learn from the writer that a ‘ musnud , ’ which in Byron 's day was a sofa , now signifies a nightingale . A ‘ tophaik , ’ which once fired away in Moore 's octosyllabics as a musket , is metamorphosed into a bank of flowers . ‘ Zemzem , ’ the sacred well , now makes shift as a chemise ; while the rallying-cry of ‘ Allah-hu ’ closes in a stanza as a military cloak . Even ‘ Gehenna , ’ the place of torment , is mitigated into a valley , rich in unctuous spices . But the most singular of all these transmutations of the Turkish vocabulary is that of the word ‘ Effendi , ’ which used to be a respectful epithet applied to a Christian gentleman , but is now the denomination of a dog . Most of these changes are certainly highly poetical , and , while we admire their ingenuity , we do not impugn their correctness . But with all respect for the author , the Honourable Sinjin Muff , we think that , in one or two instances , he has sacrificed propriety at the shrine of imagination . We do not allude to such little incongruities as the waving of a minaret , or the watching of a mosque . These may be accounted for ; but who — who , we ask with some earnestness , ever heard of cheroots growing ready-made among the grass , or of a young lady keeping an appointment in a scarf trimmed with mutton cutlets ? We say nothing to the bold idea of a dragoman , who snaps Eblis in twain , as a gardener might snap a frosted carrot ; but we will not give up our own interpretation of ‘ kiebaubs , ’ seeing that we dined upon them not two months ago at the best chop-house in Constantinople . ”</p>
