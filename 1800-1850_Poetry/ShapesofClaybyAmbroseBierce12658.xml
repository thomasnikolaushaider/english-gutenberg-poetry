    <p>AUTHOR OF “ IN THE MIDST OF LIFE , ” “ CAN SUCH THINGS BE ? ” “ BLACK BEETLES IN AMBER , ” AND “ FANTASTIC FABLES ” 1903 DEDICATION . WITH PRIDE IN THEIR WORK , FAITH IN THEIR FUTURE AND AFFECTION FOR THEMSELVES , AN OLD WRITER DEDICATES THIS BOOK TO HIS YOUNG FRIENDS AND PUPILS , GEORGE STERLING AND HERMAN SCHEFFAUER . A. B .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Some small part of this book being personally censorious , and in that part the names of real persons being used without their assent , it seems fit that a few words be said of the matter in sober prose . What it seems well to say I have already said with sufficient clarity in the preface of another book , somewhat allied to this by that feature of its character . I quote from “ Black Beetles in Amber : ”</p>
    <p n="2">“ Many of the verses in this book are republished , with considerable alterations , from various newspapers . Of my motives in writing and in now republishing I do not care to make either defence or explanation , except with reference to those who since my first censure of them have passed away . To one having only a reader 's interest in the matter it may easily seem that the verses relating to those might properly have been omitted from this collection . But if these pieces , or indeed , if any considerable part of my work in literature , have the intrinsic worth which by this attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed , their permanent suppression is impossible , and it is only a question of when and by whom they will be republished . Some one will surely search them out and put them in circulation .</p>
    <p n="3">“ I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected in his lifetime ; and this seems to me especially true of one whose work , necessarily engendering animosities , is peculiarly exposed to challenge as unjust . That is a charge that can best be examined before time has effaced the evidence . For the death of a man of whom I have written what I may venture to think worthy to live I am no way responsible ; and however sincerely I may regret it , I can hardly consent that it shall affect my literary fortunes . If the satirist who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that , while condemning the sin he should spare the sinner , were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship .</p>
    <p n="4">“ Persuaded of the validity of all this I have not hesitated to reprint even certain ‘ epitaphs ’ which , once of the living , are now of the dead , as all the others must eventually be . The objection inheres in all forms of applied satire — my understanding of whose laws and liberties is at least derived from reverent study of the masters . That in respect of matters herein mentioned I have but followed their practice can be shown by abundant instance and example . ”</p>
    <p n="5">In arranging these verses for publication I have thought it needless to classify them according to character , as “ Serious , ” “ Comic , ” “ Sentimental , ” “ Satirical , ” and so forth . I do the reader the honor to think that he will readily discern the nature of what he is reading ; and I entertain the hope that his mood will accommodate itself without disappointment to that of his author .</p>
    <p n="6">AMBROSE BIERCE .</p>

    <head>THE PASSING SHOW .</head>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">I know not if it was a dream . I viewed</l>
      <l n="2">A city where the restless multitude ,</l>
      <l n="3">Between the eastern and the western deep</l>
      <l n="4">Had roared gigantic fabrics , strong and rude .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="5">Colossal palaces crowned every height ;</l>
      <l n="6">Towers from valleys climbed into the light ;</l>
      <l n="7">O'er dwellings at their feet , great golden domes</l>
      <l n="8">Hung in the blue , barbarically bright .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="9">But now , new-glimmering to-east , the day</l>
      <l n="10">Touched the black masses with a grace of gray ,</l>
      <l n="11">Dim spires of temples to the nation 's God</l>
      <l n="12">Studding high spaces of the wide survey .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="13">Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep</l>
      <l n="14">Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep ,</l>
      <l n="15">Yet whispered of an hour-when sleepers wake ,</l>
      <l n="16">The fool to hope afresh , the wise to weep .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="17">The gardens greened upon the builded hills</l>
      <l n="18">Above the tethered thunders of the mills</l>
      <l n="19">With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet</l>
      <l n="20">By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="21">A hewn acclivity , reprieved a space ,</l>
      <l n="22">Looked on the builder 's blocks about his base</l>
      <l n="23">And bared his wounded breast in sign to say :</l>
      <l n="24">“ Strike ! ‘ t is my destiny to lodge your race .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="25">“ ‘ T was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed</l>
      <l n="26">Upon my slopes , and in my caves I housed</l>
      <l n="27">Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness ,</l>
      <l n="28">While on their foeman 's offal they caroused . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="29">Ships from afar afforested the bay .</l>
      <l n="30">Within their huge and chambered bodies lay</l>
      <l n="31">The wealth of continents ; and merrily sailed</l>
      <l n="32">The hardy argosies to far Cathay .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="33">Beside the city of the living spread —</l>
      <l n="34">Strange fellowship !— the city of the dead ;</l>
      <l n="35">And much I wondered what its humble folk ,</l>
      <l n="36">To see how bravely they were housed , had said .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="37">Noting how firm their habitations stood ,</l>
      <l n="38">Broad-based and free of perishable wood —</l>
      <l n="39">How deep in granite and how high in brass</l>
      <l n="40">The names were wrought of eminent and good ,</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="41">I said : “ When gold or power is their aim ,</l>
      <l n="42">The smile of beauty or the wage of shame ,</l>
      <l n="43">Men dwell in cities ; to this place they fare</l>
      <l n="44">When they would conquer an abiding fame . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="45">From the red East the sun — a solemn rite —</l>
      <l n="46">Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height</l>
      <l n="47">Above the dead ; and then with all his strength</l>
      <l n="48">Struck the great city all aroar with light !</l>

      <l n="49">I know not if it was a dream . I came</l>
      <l n="50">Unto a land where something seemed the same</l>
      <l n="51">That I had known as ‘ t were but yesterday ,</l>
      <l n="52">But what it was I could not rightly name .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="53">It was a strange and melancholy land .</l>
      <l n="54">Silent and desolate . On either hand</l>
      <l n="55">Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead ,</l>
      <l n="56">And dead above it seemed the hills to stand ,</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="57">Grayed all with age , those lonely hills — ah me ,</l>
      <l n="58">How worn and weary they appeared to be !</l>
      <l n="59">Between their feet long dusty fissures clove</l>
      <l n="60">The plain in aimless windings to the sea .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="61">One hill there was which , parted from the rest ,</l>
      <l n="62">Stood where the eastern water curved a-west .</l>
      <l n="63">Silent and passionless it stood . I thought</l>
      <l n="64">I saw a scar upon its giant breast .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="65">The sun with sullen and portentous gleam</l>
      <l n="66">Hung like a menace on the sea 's extreme ;</l>
      <l n="67">Nor the dead waters , nor the far , bleak bars</l>

     <l n="28">Silent , with gleaming axe and shrouded brow ,</l>

     <l n="6">From dim tarns hateful with some horrid ban ,</l>
     <l n="7">Took shapes forbidden and without a name .</l>
     <l n="8">Gigantic night-birds , rising from the reeds</l>
     <l n="9">With cries discordant , startled all the air ,</l>
     <l n="10">And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom —</l>
     <l n="11">The ghosts of blasphemies long ages stilled ,</l>
     <l n="12">And shrieks of women , and men 's curses . All</l>

     <l n="22">Imperfect witness . As I stood a voice ,</l>
     <l n="23">But whence it came I knew not , cried aloud</l>

     <l n="25">Yet straight I knew me for a ghost forlorn ,</l>

     <l n="28">As in reply to something which in me</l>

     <l n="1">A famous journalist , who long</l>

     <l n="4">Was true as Holy Writ , and right ,</l>
     <l n="5">Was caught in — well , on second thought ,</l>
     <l n="6">It is enough that he was caught ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ Vox populi vox Dei , ” said</l>
     <l n="10">The jailer . Inxling bent his head</l>
     <l n="11">Without remark : that motto good</l>
     <l n="12">In bold-faced type had always stood</l>

     <l n="35">The law 's traditional delay</l>

     <l n="39">And all the motions counsel made</l>
     <l n="40">Could not move him — and there he stayed .</l>
     <l n="41">“ The case must now proceed , ” he said ,</l>

    <head>MR. FINK 'S DEBATING DONKEY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of a person known as Peters I will humbly crave your leave</l>
     <l n="2">An unusual adventure into narrative to weave —</l>
     <l n="3">Mr. William Perry Peters , of the town of Muscatel ,</l>
     <l n="4">A public educator and an orator as well .</l>
     <l n="5">Mr. Peters had a weakness which , ‘ tis painful to relate ,</l>
     <l n="6">Was a strong predisposition to the pleasures of debate .</l>
     <l n="7">He would foster disputation wheresoever he might be ;</l>
     <l n="8">In polygonal contention none so happy was as he .</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Twas observable , however , that the exercises ran</l>
     <l n="10">Into monologue by Peters , that rhetorical young man .</l>
     <l n="11">And the Muscatelian rustics who assisted at the show ,</l>
     <l n="12">By involuntary silence testified their overthrow —</l>
     <l n="13">Mr. Peters , all unheedful of their silence and their grief ,</l>
     <l n="14">Still effacing every vestige of erroneous belief .</l>
     <l n="15">O , he was a sore affliction to all heretics so bold</l>
     <l n="16">As to entertain opinions that he did n't care to hold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">One day — ‘ t was in pursuance of a pedagogic plan</l>
     <l n="18">For the mental elevation of Uncultivated Man —</l>
     <l n="19">Mr. Peters , to his pupils , in dismissing them , explained</l>
     <l n="20">That the Friday evening following ( unless , indeed , it rained )</l>
     <l n="21">Would be signalized by holding in the schoolhouse a debate</l>
     <l n="22">Free to all who their opinions might desire to ventilate</l>
     <l n="23">On the question , “ Which is better , as a serviceable gift ,</l>
     <l n="24">Speech or hearing , from barbarity the human mind to lift ? ”</l>
     <l n="25">The pupils told their fathers , who , forehanded always , met</l>
     <l n="26">At the barroom to discuss it every evening , dry or wet ,</l>
     <l n="27">They argued it and argued it and spat upon the stove ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the non-committal “ barkeep ” on their differences throve .</l>
     <l n="29">And I state it as a maxim in a loosish kind of way :</l>
     <l n="30">You 'll have the more to back your word the less you have to say .</l>
     <l n="31">Public interest was lively , but one Ebenezer Fink</l>
     <l n="32">Of the Rancho del Jackrabbit , only seemed to sit and think .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">On the memorable evening all the men of Muscatel</l>
     <l n="34">Came to listen to the logic and the eloquence as well —</l>
     <l n="35">All but William Perry Peters , whose attendance there , I fear .</l>
     <l n="36">Was to wreak his ready rhetoric upon the public ear ,</l>
     <l n="37">And prove ( whichever side he took ) that hearing would n't lift</l>
     <l n="38">The human mind as ably as the other , greater gift .</l>
     <l n="39">The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled ,</l>
     <l n="40">The question he proceeded in extenso to unfold :</l>
     <l n="41">“ Resolved — The sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach</l>
     <l n="42">Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech . ”</l>
     <l n="43">This simple proposition he expounded , word by word ,</l>
     <l n="44">Until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard .</l>
     <l n="45">Even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain —</l>
     <l n="46">The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain .</l>
     <l n="47">Beginning at a period before Creation 's morn ,</l>
     <l n="48">He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn .</l>
     <l n="49">As down the early centuries of pre-historic time</l>
     <l n="50">He tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="51">And Whisky Bill , prosaic soul ! proclaiming him a jay ,</l>
     <l n="52">Had risen and like an earthquake , “ reeled unheededly away , ”</l>
     <l n="53">And a late lamented cat , when opportunity should serve ,</l>
     <l n="54">Was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve ,</l>
     <l n="55">A noise arose outside — the door was opened with a bang</l>
     <l n="56">And old Ebenezer Fink was heard ejaculating “ G'lang ! ”</l>
     <l n="57">Straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink</l>
     <l n="58">An ancient ass — the property it was of Mr. Fink .</l>
     <l n="59">Its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread ,</l>
     <l n="60">Silent through silence moved amain that stately quadruped !</l>
     <l n="61">It stopped before the orator , and in the lamplight thrown</l>
     <l n="62">Upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone .</l>
     <l n="63">Then spake old Ebenezer : “ Gents , I heern o ’ this debate</l>
     <l n="64">On w'ether v'ice or y'ears is best the mind to elevate .</l>
     <l n="65">Now ‘ yer 's a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme :</l>
     <l n="66">He has ‘ em both , I 'm free to say , oncommonly extreme .</l>
     <l n="67">He wa'n ' t invited for to speak , but he will not refuse</l>
     <l n="68">( If t'other gentleman ken wait ) to exposay his views . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="69">Ere merriment or anger o'er amazement could prevail ;</l>
     <l n="70">He cut the string that held the stone on that canary 's tail .</l>
     <l n="71">Freed from the weight , that member made a gesture of delight ,</l>
     <l n="72">Then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite .</l>
     <l n="73">With lifted head and level ears along his withers laid ,</l>
     <l n="74">Jack sighed , refilled his lungs and then — to put it mildly — brayed !</l>
     <l n="75">He brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills ,</l>
     <l n="76">And sleeping women rose and fled , in divers kinds of frills .</l>
     <l n="77">‘ T is said that awful bugle-blast — to make the story brief —</l>
     <l n="78">Wafted William Perry Peters through the window , like a leaf !</l>

Noting some great man 's composition vile : A head of wisdom and a heart of guile , A will to conquer and a soul to dare , Joined to the manners of a dancing bear , Fools unaccustomed to the wide survey Of various Nature 's compensating sway , Untaught to separate the wheat and chaff , To praise the one and at the other laugh , Yearn all in vain and impotently seek Some flawless hero upon whom to wreak The sycophantic worship of the weak . Not so the wise , from superstition free , Who find small pleasure in the bended knee ; Quick to discriminate ‘ twixt good and bad , And willing in the king to find the cad — No reason seen why genius and conceit , The power to dazzle and the will to cheat , The love of daring and the love of gin , Should not dwell , peaceful , in a single skin .

   <p>DIES IRAE .</p>
   <p>A recent republication of the late Gen. John A. Dix 's disappointing translation of this famous medieval hymn , together with some researches into its history which I happened to be making at the time , induces me to undertake a translation myself . It may seem presumption in me to attempt that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have attempted before me ; but the conspicuous failure of others encourages me to hope that success , being still unachieved , is still achievable . The fault of previous translations , from Lord Macaulay 's to that of Gen. Dix , has been , I venture to think , a too strict literalness , whereby the delicate irony and subtle humor of the immortal poem — though doubtless these admirable qualities were well appreciated by the translators — have been utterly sacrificed in the result . In none of the English versions that I have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of insincerity pervading the whole prayer ,— the cool effrontery of the suppliant in enumerating his demerits , his serenely illogical demands of salvation in spite , or rather because , of them , his meek submission to the punishment of others , and the many similarly pleasing characteristics of this amusing work , being most imperfectly conveyed . By permitting myself a reasonable freedom of rendering — in many cases boldly supplying that “ missing link ” between the sublime and the ridiculous which the author , writing for the acute monkish apprehension of the 13th century , did not deem it necessary to insert — I have hoped at least partially to liberate the lurking devil of humor from his fetters , letting him caper , not , certainly , as he does in the Latin , but as he probably would have done had his creator written in English . In preserving the metre and double rhymes of the original , I have acted from the same reverent regard for the music with which , in the liturgy of the Church , the verses have become inseparably wedded that inspired Gen. Dix ; seeking rather to surmount the obstacles to success by honest effort , than to avoid them by the adoption of an easier versification which would have deprived my version of all utility in religious service .</p>
   <p>I must bespeak the reader 's charitable consideration in respect of the first stanza , the insuperable difficulties of which seem to have been purposely contrived in order to warn off trespassers at the very boundary of the alluring domain . I have got over the inhibition — somehow — but David and the Sibyl must try to forgive me if they find themselves represented merely by the names of those conspicuous personal qualities to which they probably owed , respectively , their powers of prophecy , as Samson 's strength lay in his hair .</p>
