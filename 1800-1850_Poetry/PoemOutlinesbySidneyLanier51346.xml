   <p>NOTE</p>
   <p>It requires but little intimacy with the true artist to see that , whether his medium of expression be words or music or the brush , much of his finest achievement can never be given to his fellows bearing the stamp of perfect craftsmanship . As when the painter , with hand momentarily inspired by the fervor of the eye , fixes in a sketch some miracle of color or line , which vanishes with each succeeding stroke of the brush laboring to embody it in a finished picture — so the poet may transcribe one note of his own tense heart strings ; may find fluttering words that zigzag aerially beside the elusive new-born thought ; may strike out in the rough some heaven-scaling conception — to discover too often that these priceless fragments cannot be fused again , cannot be joined with commoner metals into a conventional quatrain or sonnet .</p>
   <p>At such moments , by some subtle necromancy of quivering genius , the poet in his exaltation weaves sinuous words into a magic net with which he snares at one cast the elfin woods fancies , the shy butterfly ideas that flit across secluded glades of the imagination , invisible even to him at other times ; and there these delicate creatures lie , flashing forth from the meshes glimpses of an unearthly brilliance — for all time , if he be wise enough not to attempt to open the net and spread out their wings for the world to see them better . Or it may be that his mood is interrupted by the necessity for giving to the world that which it will receive in exchange for a living , and his next vision is of a far distant corner of the Enchanted Land . Yet these records are what they are ; they bear star dust upon their wings ; they give , perhaps , his most intimate revelation , his highest utterance .</p>
   <p>So the following outlines and fragments left by Sidney Lanier are presented , in the belief that they contain the essence of poetry . His mind budded into poems as naturally and inevitably as a tree puts forth green leaves — and it was always spring-time there . These poem-sketches were jotted in pencil on the backs of envelopes , on the margins of musical programmes , on little torn scraps of paper , amid all sorts of surroundings , whenever the dream came to him . Some are mere flashes of simile in unrhymed couplets ; others are definite rounded outlines , instinct with the beauty of idea , but not yet hewn to the line of perfect form ; one , at least , is the beginning of quite a long narrative in verse . There are indications of more than one projected volume of poems , as mentioned in foot-notes . All have been selected from his papers as containing something worthy of preservation ; and , while the thought sometimes parallels that in his published work , all are essentially new .</p>

     <l n="2">Are ye so sharp set for the centre of the earth , are ye so hungry for</l>

   <p>Towards the centre of the earth , towards the very Middle of things , ye will fall , ye will run , the Centre will draw ye , Gravity will drive you and draw you in one :</p>
   <p>But the Centre ye will not reach , ye will come as near as the plains — watering them in coming so near — and ye will come as near as the bottom of the Ocean — seeing and working many marvels as ye come so near .</p>
   <p>But the Centre of Things ye will not reach ,</p>
   <p>O my rivers and rains and springs of the mountains .</p>

   <p>Nor shall my Soul be merged in God , though tending , though tending .</p>
   <note>Hymns of the Mountains , and Other Poems</note>
   <p>To believe in God would be much less hard if it were not for the wind . Pray hold one little minute , I cry : O spare this once to bite yonder poor old shivering soul in the bare house , let the rags have but a little chance to warm yon woman round the city corner . Stop , stop , wind : but I might as well talk to the wind : and lo , the proverb paralyzes prayer , and I am ready to say : Good God , is it possible thou canst stop this wind which at this moment is mocking ten thousand babies and thin-clad mothers with the unimaginable anguish of cold — is it possible thou canst stop this , and wilt not ? Do you know what cold is ? Story of the Prisoner , &amp; c ., &amp; c ., and the stone .</p>
   <p>The courses of the wind , and the shifts thereof , as also what way the clouds go ; and that which is happening a long way off ; and the full face of the sun ; and the bow of the Milky Way from end to end ; as also the small , the life of the fiddler-crab , and the household of the marsh-hen ; and more , the translation of black ooze into green blade of marsh-grass , which is as if filth bred heaven :</p>
   <p>This a man seeth upon the marsh .</p>

   <p>One of your cold jelly-fish poets that find themselves cast up by some wave upon a sandy subject , and so wrinkle themselves about a pebble of a theme and let us see it through their substance — as if that were a great feat .</p>
   <p>Cousin cloud the wind of music blow me into wreath and curve of grace as it bloweth thee .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And then</l>
     <l n="2">A gentle violin mated with the flute ,</l>
     <l n="3">And both flew off into a wood of harmony ,</l>
     <l n="4">Two doves of tone .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have great trouble in behavior . I know what to do , I know what I at heart desire to do ; but the doing of it , that is work , that labor is . I construct in my lonesome meditations the fairest scheme of my relations to my fellow-men , and to fellow-events ; but when I go to set the words of solitary thought to the music of much-crowded action , I find ten thousand difficulties never suspected : difficulties of race , temperament , mood , tradition , custom , passion , unreason and other difficulties which I do not understand , as , for instance , the failure of contemporary men to recognize genius and great art .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I made me a song of serenade ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I stole in the Night , in the Night ,</l>
     <l n="3">To the window of the world where man slept light ,</l>
     <l n="4">And I sang :</l>
     <l n="5">O my Love , my Love , my Fellow Man ,</l>
     <l n="6">My Love .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I fled in tears from the men 's ungodly quarrel about God : I fled in tears to the woods , and laid me down on the earth ; then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground , and I looked and my cheek lay close by a violet ; then my heart took courage and I said :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I know that thou art the word of my God , dear Violet :</l>
     <l n="2">And Oh the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads .</l>
     <l n="3">Measure what space a violet stands above the ground ,</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Tis no farther climbing that my soul and angels have to do than that . ”</l>

     <l n="1">While I lie here under the tree ,</l>

     <l n="4">Then perceiving that I have nothing of nutriment for him ,</l>
     <l n="5">He leaves me with a quiet indifference which , do all I can ,</l>
     <l n="6">Crushes me more than the whole world 's sarcasm ,</l>
     <l n="7">And now he is gone to the Jamestown weed , there ,</l>

   <p>A man does not reach any stature of manhood until like Moses he kills an Egyptian ( i. e ., murders some oppressive prejudice of the all-crushing Tyrant Society or Custom or Orthodoxy ) and flies into the desert of his own soul , where among the rocks and sands , over which at any rate the sun rises dear each day , he slowly and with great agony settles his relation with men and manners and powers outside , and begins to look with his own eyes , and first knows the unspeakable joy of the outcast 's kiss upon the hand of sweet , naked Truth .</p>
   <p>But let not the young man go to killing his Egyptian too soon : wait till you know all the Egyptians can teach you : wait till you are master of the technics of the time ; then grave , and resolute , and aware of consequences , shape your course .</p>
   <p>Thought , too , is carnivorous . It lives on meat . We never have an idea whose existence has not been purchased by the death of some atom of our fleshy tissue .</p>
   <p>O little poem , thou goest from this brain chargeable with the death of tissue that perished in order that thou mightst live : nourish some soul , thou that hast been nourished on a human body .</p>
   <p>Do you think the 19th century is past ? It is but two years since Boston burnt me for witchcraft . I wrote a poem which was not orthodox : that is , not like Mr. Longfellow 's .</p>

   <p>Youth , the circus-rider , fares gaily round the ring , standing with one foot on the bare-backed horse — the Ideal . Presently , at the moment of manhood , Life ( exacting ring-master ) causes another horse to be brought in who passes under the rider 's legs , and ambles on . This is the Real . The young man takes up the reins , places a foot on each animal , and the business now becomes serious .</p>
   <p>For it is a differing pace , of these two , the Real and the Ideal .</p>
   <p>And yet no man can be said to make the least success in life who does not contrive to make them go well together .</p>
   <p>The Age is an Adonis that pursues the boar Wealth : yet shall the rude tusk of trade wound this blue-veined thigh ,— if Love come not to the rescue ; Adon despises Love .</p>
   <p>Sometimes Providence seems to have a bee in his bonnet . Else why should hell , the greatest risk , be the most improvable fact , and himself , the only light , be the most completely undiscoverable ? If the angels are good company , why shut us out from them ? I look for good boys for my children . Hide not your light under a bushel , is His own command : and yet He is completely obscured under the inexorable quid pro quo of Nature and the hateful measure of Evil .</p>

I sat on the steps — warm summer noon — in a garden , and half cloudy with low clouds , sun hot , rich mocking bird singing , bee brushing down a big raindrop from a flower , where it hung tremulous . The bird 's music is echoed from the breasts of roses , and reflex sound comes doubly back with grace of odor .— First came the lizard , dandiest of reptiles ; then the bee , then small strange insects that wear flap-wings and spider-web legs , and crawl up the slim green stalks of grass ; the catbirds , the flowers , with each a soul — this is the company I like ; the talk , the gossip anent the last news of the spirit , the marriage of man and nature , the betrothal of Science and Art , the failure of the great house of Buy and Sell ( see following note [ 1 ]) , a rumor out of the sun , and many messages concerning the stars .</head>
     <l n="1">Footnote 1 :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Buy and Sell failed because Love was a partner . “ This Love , now , who is he ? ” said a comfortable burgher oak . “ I hear much of him these later days . ” Why , Love , he owneth all things : trees and land and water power .</p>

     <l n="1">Oh , man falls into this wide sea of life</l>
     <l n="2">Like a pebble dropped by idle bands in water .</l>
     <l n="3">The little circle of the stir he makes</l>
     <l n="4">Does lessen as it widens , until Death</l>
     <l n="5">Comes on , and straightway the round ripple is gone out .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Death is the cup-bearer of Heaven , God 's Ganymede , and his cup is the grave , and life is the wine that fills it .</p>
   <p>Birth is but a folding of our wings .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When bees , in honey-frenzies , rage and rage ,</l>
     <l n="2">And their hot dainty wars with flowers wage ,</l>
     <l n="3">Foraying in the woods for sweet rapine</l>
     <l n="4">And spreading odorous havoc o'er the green .</l>

   <p>All men are pearl-divers , and we have but plunged down into this straggling salt-sea of Life — to find a pearl . This Pearl , like all others , comes from a wound : it is the Pearl of Love after Grief .</p>
   <p>It is always sunrise and always sunset somewhere on the earth . And so , with a silver sunrise before him and a golden sunset behind him , the Royal Sun fares through Heaven , like a king with a herald and a retinue .</p>
   <p>Night 's a black-haired poet , and he 's in love with Day . But he never meets her save at early morn and late eve , when they fall into each other 's arms and draw out a lingering kiss : so folded together at such times that we cannot distinguish bright maid from dark lover ; and so we call it Dawn and Twilight — it being</p>

   <p>Hunger and a whip : with these we tame wild beasts . So , to tame us , God continually keeps our hearts hungry for love , and continually lashes our souls with the thongs of relentless circumstance .</p>
   <p>Star-drops lingering after sunlight 's rain .</p>
   <p>The earth , a grain of pollen dropped in the vast calyx of Heaven .</p>
   <p>Our beliefs needed pruning , that they might bring forth more fruit : and so Science came .</p>
   <p>I , the artist , fought with a Knight that was cased in a mail of gold ; and my weapon , with all my art , would not penetrate his armor . Gold is a soft metal , but makes the hardest hauberk of all . What shall I do to pierce this covering ? For I am hungry for this man , this business man of stocks and drygoods , and now it seems as if there were no pleasure nor hope nor life for me until I win him to my side .</p>

     <l n="1">My Desire is round ,</l>
     <l n="2">It is a great globe .</l>
     <l n="3">If my desire were no bigger than this world</l>
     <l n="4">It were no bigger than a pin 's head .</l>
     <l n="5">But this world is to the world I want</l>
     <l n="6">As a cinder to Sirius .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am startled at the gigantic suggestions in this old story of the Serpent who introduces knowledge to man in Eden . How could the Jew who wrote Genesis have known the sadness that ever comes with learning — as if wisdom were still the protégé of the Devil .</p>
   <p>On the advantage of reducing facts — like fractions — to a common denominator .</p>
   <p>We explain : but only in terms of x and y , which are themselves symbols of we know not what , graphs of mystery . We establish relations betwixt this and that mystery . We reduce x and y to a common denominator , so that we can add them together , and make a scientific generalization , or subtract them , and make a scientific analysis : but more we can not do . The mystery is still a mystery , and this is all the material out of which we must weave our life .</p>

   <p>The Church is too hot , and Nothing is too cold . I find my proper Temperature in Art . Art offers to me a method of adoring the sweet master Jesus Christ , the beautiful souled One , without the straitness of a Creed which confines my genuflexions , a Church which confines my limbs , and without the vacuity of the doubt which numbs them . An unspeakable gain has come to me in simply turning a certain phrase the other way : the beauty of holiness becomes a new and wonderful saying to me when I figure it to myself in reverse as the holiness of beauty . This is like opening a window of dark stained glass , and letting in a flood of white light . I thus keep upon the walls of my soul a church-wall rubric which has been somewhat clouded by the expiring breaths of creeds dying their natural death . For in art there is no doubt . My heart beat all last night without my supervision : for I was asleep ; my heart did not doubt a throb ; I left it beating when I slept , I found it beating when I woke ; it is thus with art : it beats in my sleep . A holy tune was in my soul when I fell asleep : it was going when I awoke . This melody is always moving along in the background of my spirit . If I wish to compose , I abstract my attention from the thoughts which occupy the front of the stage , the dramatis personæ of the moment , and fix myself upon the deeper scene in the rear .</p>
   <p>It is now time that one should arise in the world and cry out that Art is made for man and not man for art : that government is made for man and not man for government : that religion is made for man and not man for religion : that trade is made for man and not man for trade . This is essentially the utterance of Christ in declaring that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath .</p>
   <p>Like the forest whose edges near man 's dwellings are embroidered with birds , while its inner recesses are the unbroken solid color of solitude .</p>

   <p>I knew a saint that said he never went among men without returning home less a man than he was before he went forth . But it is not so with you : I am always more a man when I converse with you . Who is so manly and so manifold sweet as a tree ? There is none that can talk like a tree : for a tree says always to me exactly that which I wish him to say . A man is apt to say what I did not desire to hear , or what I had no need to know at that time . A tree knows always my necessity .</p>
