     <l n="9">His mouth , decidedly carnivorous ,</l>

     <l n="22">He was bare of arm and leg ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="30">But he stored his mind with learning stable ,</l>

     <l n="33">Of witches and warlocks , goblins and fays ;</l>

     <l n="37">Freed the captive , and succoured the damsel distrest</l>

     <l n="40">An ’ I live to become a man ,— I 'm blest ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="41">Jack lightly recked of sport or play</l>
     <l n="42">Wherein young gentlemen delight ,</l>
     <l n="43">But he would wrestle any day ,</l>
     <l n="44">Box , or at backsword fight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="45">He was a lad of special “ pluck , ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="49">His task assigned , like Giles or Hodge ,</l>

     <l n="52">Wool-gathering oft would wend .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="57">Now this behaviour did evince</l>
     <l n="58">A longing for a foe to mince ;</l>
     <l n="59">An instinct fitter for a Prince</l>
