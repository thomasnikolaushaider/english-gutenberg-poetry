    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="6">[ The Dramatic Romances ,...] enriched by some of the poems originally printed in Men and Women , and a few from Dramatic Lyrics as first printed , include some of Browning 's finest and most characteristic work . In several of them the poet displays his familiarity with the life and spirit of the Renaissance — a period portrayed by him with a fidelity more real than history — for he enters into the feelings that give rise to action , while the historian is busied only with the results growing out of the moving force of feeling .</p>
    <p n="7">The egotism of the Ferrara husband outraged at the gentle wife because she is as gracious toward those who rendered her small courtesies , and seemed as thankful to them as she was to him for his gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name , opens up for inspection the heart of a husband at a time when men exercised complete control over their wives , and could satisfy their jealous , selfish instincts by any cruel methods they chose to adopt , with no one to say them “ nay . ” The highly developed artistic sense shown by this husband is not incompatible with his consummate selfishness and cruelty , as many tales of that time might be brought forward to illustrate . The husband in “ The Statue and the Bust ” belongs to the same type , and the situation there is the inevitable outcome of a civilization in which women were not consulted as to whom they would marry , and naturally often fell a prey to love if it should come to them afterwards . Weakness of will in the case of the lovers in this poem wrecked their lives ; for they were not strong enough to follow either duty or love . Another glimpse is caught of this period when husbands and brothers and fathers meted out what they considered justice to the women in “ In a Gondola . ” “ The Grammarian 's Funeral ” gives also an aspect of Renaissance life — the fervor for learning characteristic of the earlier days of the Renaissance when devoted pedants , as Arthur Symons says in referring to this poem , broke ground in the restoration to the modern world of the civilization and learning of ancient Greece and Rome . Again , “ The Heretic 's Tragedy ” and “ Holy-Cross Day ” picture most vividly the methods resorted to by the dying church in its attempts to keep control of the souls of a humanity seething toward religious tolerance .</p>
    <p n="8">With only a small space at command , it is difficult to decide on the poems to be touched upon , especially where there is not one but would repay prolonged attention , due no less to the romantic interest of the stories , the marvellous penetration into human motives , the grasp of historical atmospheres , than to the originality and perfection of their artistry .</p>
    <p n="9">A word must be said of “ The Flight of the Duchess ” and “ Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came , ” both poems which have been productive of many commentaries , and both holding their own amid the bray [ sic ] of critics as unique and beautiful specimens of poetic art . Certainly no two poems could be chosen to show wider diversity in the poet 's genius than these .</p>
    <p n="10">The story told by the huntsman in “ The Flight of the Duchess ” is interesting enough simply as a story , but the telling of it is inimitable . One can see before him the devoted , kindly man , somewhat clumsy of speech , as indicated by the rough rhymes , and characteristically drawing his illustrations from the calling he follows . Keen in his critical observation of the Duke and other members of the household , he , nevertheless , has a tender appreciation of the difficulties of the young Duchess in this unloving artificial environment .</p>
    <p n="11">When the Gypsy Queen sings her song through his memory of it , the rhymes and rhythm take on a befitting harmoniousness and smoothness contrasting finely with the remainder of the poem .</p>
    <p n="12">By means of this song , moreover , the horizon is enlarged beyond the immediate ken of the huntsman . The race-instinct , which has so strong a hold upon the Gypsies , is exalted into a wondrous sort of love which carries everything before it . This loving reality is also set over against the unloving artificiality of the first part of the poem . The temptation is too strong for the love-starved little Duchess , and even the huntsman and Jacinth come under her hypnotic spell .</p>
    <p n="13">Very different in effect is “ Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came . ” The one , rich in this lay of human emotion , couched in the simple language of reality ; the other , a symbolic picture of the struggle and aspiration of the soul . Interpreters have tried to pin this latter poem down to the limits of an allegory , and find a specific meaning for every phrase and picture , but it has too much the quality of the modern symbolistic writing to admit of any treatment so prosaic . In this respect it resembles music . Each mind will draw from it an interpretation suited to its own attitude and experiences . Reduced to the simplest possible lines of interpretation , it symbolizes the inevitable fate which drives a truth-seeking soul to see the falsity of ideals once thought absolute , yet in the face of the ruin of those ideals courage toward the continuance of aspiration is never for a moment lost .</p>
    <p n="14">As a bit of art , it is strikingly imaginative , and suggests the picture-quality of the tapestried horse , which Browning himself says was the chief inspiration of the poem . It is a fine example of the way in which the “ strange and winged ” fancy of the poet may take its flight from so simple an object as this tapestried horse , evidently a sorry beast too , in its needled presentment , or the poetic impulse would not have expressed itself in the vindictive , “ I never saw a horse [ sic ] I hated so . ”</p>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">That 's my last Duchess painted on the wall ,</l>
       <l n="3">Looking as if she were alive . I call</l>
       <l n="4">That piece a wonder , now : Fra Pandolf 's hands</l>
       <l n="5">Worked busily a day , and there she stands .</l>
       <l n="6">Will't please you sit and look at her ? I said</l>
       <l n="7">“ Fra Pandolf ” by design , for never read</l>
       <l n="8">Strangers like you that pictured countenance ,</l>
       <l n="9">The depth and passion of its earnest glance ,</l>
       <l n="10">But to myself they turned ( since none puts by</l>
       <l n="11">the curtain I have drawn for you , but I ) 10</l>
       <l n="12">And seemed as they would ask me , if they durst ,</l>
       <l n="13">How such a glance came there ; so , not the first</l>
       <l n="14">Are you to turn and ask thus . Sir , ‘ twas not</l>
       <l n="15">Her husband 's presence only , called that spot</l>
       <l n="16">Of joy into the Duchess ’ cheek : perhaps</l>
       <l n="17">Fra Pandolf chanced to say “ Her mantle laps</l>
       <l n="18">Over my lady 's wrist too much , ” or “ Paint</l>
       <l n="19">Must never hope to reproduce the faint</l>
       <l n="20">Half-flush that dies along her throat ” ; such stuff</l>
       <l n="21">Was courtesy , she thought , and cause enough 20</l>
       <l n="22">For calling up that spot of joy . She had</l>
       <l n="23">A heart — how shall I say — too soon made glad ,</l>
       <l n="24">Too easily impressed ; she liked whate'er</l>
       <l n="25">She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .</l>
       <l n="26">Sir , ‘ twas all one ! My favour at her breast ,</l>
       <l n="27">The dropping of the daylight in the West ,</l>
       <l n="28">The bough of cherries some officious fool</l>
       <l n="29">Broke in the orchard for her , the white mule</l>
       <l n="30">She rode with round the terrace — all and each</l>
       <l n="31">Would draw from her alike the approving speech , 30</l>
       <l n="32">Or blush , at least . She thanked men — good ! but thanked</l>
       <l n="33">Somehow — I know not how — as if she ranked</l>
       <l n="34">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</l>
       <l n="35">With anybody 's gift . Who 'd stoop to blame</l>
       <l n="36">This sort of trifling ? Even had you skill</l>
       <l n="37">In speech ( which I have not ) to make your will</l>
       <l n="38">Quite clear to such an one , and say , “ Just this</l>
       <l n="39">Or that in you disgusts me ; here you miss ,</l>
       <l n="40">Or there exceed the mark ” — and if she let</l>
       <l n="41">Herself be lessoned so , nor plainly set 40</l>
       <l n="42">Her wits to yours , forsooth , and made excuse ,</l>
       <l n="43">E'en that would be some stooping ; and I choose</l>
       <l n="44">Never to stoop . Oh sir , she smiled , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="45">Whene'er I passed her ; but who passed without</l>
       <l n="46">Much the same smile ? This grew ; I gave commands ;</l>
       <l n="47">Then all smiles stopped together . There she stands</l>
       <l n="48">As if alive . Will't please you rise ? We 'll meet</l>
       <l n="49">The company below , then . I repeat ,</l>
       <l n="50">The Count your master 's known munificence</l>
       <l n="51">Is ample warrant that no just pretence 50</l>
       <l n="52">Of mine for dowry will be disallowed ;</l>
       <l n="53">Though his fair daughter 's self , as I avowed</l>
       <l n="54">At starting , is my object . Nay , we 'll go</l>
       <l n="55">Together down , sir . Notice Neptune , though ,</l>

      <head>NOTES : “ Count Gismond : Aix in Provence ” illustrates , in the person of the woman who relates to a friend an episode of her own life , the power of innate purity to raise up for her a defender when caught in the toils woven by the unsuspected envy and hypocrisy of her cousins and Count Gauthier , who attempt to bring dishonor upon her , on her birthday , with the seeming intention of honoring her . Her faith that the trial by combat between Gauthier and Gismond must end in Gismond 's victory and her vindication reflects most truly , as Arthur Symons has pointed out , the medieval atmosphere of chivalrous France .</head>

      <head>NOTES : “ The Glove ” gives a transcript from Court life , in Paris , under Francis I . In making Ronsard the mouthpiece for a deeper observation of the meaning of the incident he is supposed to witness and describe than Marot and the rest saw , characteristic differences between these two poets of the time are brought out , the genuineness of courtly love and chivalry is tested , and to the original story of the glove is added a new view of the lady 's character ; a sketch of her humbler and truer lover , and their happiness ; and a pendent scene showing the courtier De Lorges , having won a beauty for his wife , in the ignominious position of assisting the king to enjoy her favors and of submitting to pleasantries upon his discomfiture . The original story as told by Poullain de St. Croix in his Essais Historiques sur Paris ran thus : “ One day whilst Francis I amused himself with looking at a combat between his lions , a lady , having let her glove drop , said to De Lorges , ‘ If you would have me believe that you love me as much as you swear you do , go and bring back my glove . ’ De Lorges went down , picked up the glove from amidst the ferocious beasts , returned , and threw it in the lady 's face ; and in spite of all her advances and cajoleries would never look at her again . ' ’ Schiller running across this anecdote of St. Croix , in 1797 , as he writes Goethe , wrote a poem on it which adds nothing to the story . Leigh Hunt 's ‘ The Glove and the Lions ’ adds some traits . It characterizes the lady as shallow and vain , with smiles and eyes which always seem 'd the same . ' ’ She calculates since “ king , ladies , lovers , all look on , ” that “ the occasion is divine ” to drop her glove and “ prove his love , then look at him and smile ” ; and after De Lorges has returned and thrown the glove , “ but not with love , right in the lady 's face ,' ’ Hunt makes the king rise and swear “ rightly done ! No love , quoth he , but vanity , sets love a task like that ! ' ’ This is the material Browning worked on ; he makes use of this speech of the king 's , but remodels the lady 's character wholly , and gives her an appreciative lover , and also a keen-eyed young poet to tell her story afresh and to reveal through his criticism the narrowness of the Court and the Court poets .</head>
      <p>12 . Naso : Ovid . Love of the classics and curiosity as to human nature were both characteristic of Peter Ronsard ( 1524-1585 ) , at one time page to Francis I , the most erudite and original of French medieval poets .</p>
      <p n="1">45 . Clement Marot : ( 1496-1544 ) , Court poet to Francis I . His nature and verse were simpler than Ronsard 's , and he belonged more peculiarly to his own day .</p>
      <p n="2">48 . Versifies David : Marot was suspected of Protestant leanings which occasioned his imprisonment twice , and put him in need of the protection Francis and his sister gave him . Among his works were sixty-five epistles addressed to grandees , attesting his courtiership , and the paraphrase of forty-nine of the Psalms to which Ronsard alludes .</p>
      <p n="3">50 . Illum Juda , etc . : that lion of the tribe of Judah .</p>
      <p n="4">89 . Venienti , etc . : Meet the coming disease ; that is , if evil be anticipated , do n't wait till it seizes you , but dare to assure yourself and then forestall it as the lady did .</p>
      <p n="5">190 . Theorbo : an old Italian stringed instrument such as pages used .</p>

      <head>NOTES : “ Time 's Revenges . ” An author soliloquizes in his garret over the fact that he possesses a friend who loves him and would do anything in his power to serve him , but for whom he cares almost nothing . At the same time he himself loves a woman to such distraction that he counts himself crowned with love 's best crown while sacrificing his soul , his body , his peace , and his fame in brooding on his love , while she could calmly decree that he should roast at a slow fire if it would compass her frivolously ambitious designs . Thus his indifference to his friend is avenged by the indifference the lady shows toward him .</head>
      <p>46 . The Florentine : Dante . Used here , seemingly , as a symbol of the highest attainments in poesy , his ( the speaker 's ) reverence for which is so great that he would rather put his cheek under his lady 's foot than that poetry should suffer any indignity at his hands ; yet in spite of all the possibilities open to him through his enthusiasm for poetry , he prefers wasting his entire energies upon one unworthy of him .</p>

       <l n="8">Where I and Charles , when boys , have plucked</l>
       <l n="9">The fire-flies from the roof above ,</l>

       <l n="15">The sky broke out in red dismay</l>
       <l n="16">With signal fires ; well , there I lay</l>
       <l n="17">Close covered o'er in my recess ,</l>
       <l n="18">Up to the neck in ferns and cress ,</l>
       <l n="19">Thinking on Metternich our friend ,</l>
       <l n="20">And Charles 's miserable end , 20</l>
       <l n="21">And much beside , two days ; the third ,</l>
       <l n="22">Hunger overcame me when I heard</l>
       <l n="23">The peasants from the village go</l>
       <l n="24">To work among the maize ; you know ,</l>
       <l n="25">With us in Lombardy , they bring</l>
       <l n="26">Provisions packed on mules , a string</l>
       <l n="27">With little bells that cheer their task ,</l>
       <l n="28">And casks , and boughs on every cask</l>
       <l n="29">To keep the sun 's heat from the wine ;</l>
       <l n="30">These I let pass in jingling line , 30</l>
       <l n="31">And , close on them , dear noisy crew ,</l>
       <l n="32">The peasants from the village , too ;</l>
       <l n="33">For at the very rear would troop</l>
       <l n="34">Their wives and sisters in a group</l>
       <l n="35">To help , I knew . When these had passed ,</l>
       <l n="36">I threw my glove to strike the last ,</l>
       <l n="37">Taking the chance : she did not start ,</l>
       <l n="38">Much less cry out , but stooped apart ,</l>
       <l n="39">One instant rapidly glanced round ,</l>
       <l n="40">And saw me beckon from the ground . 40</l>
       <l n="41">A wild bush grows and hides my crypt ;</l>
       <l n="42">She picked my glove up while she stripped</l>
       <l n="43">A branch off , then rejoined the rest</l>
       <l n="44">With that ; my glove lay in her breast .</l>
       <l n="45">Then I drew breath ; they disappeared :</l>
       <l n="46">It was for Italy I feared .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="47">An hour , and she returned alone</l>
       <l n="48">Exactly where my glove was thrown .</l>
       <l n="49">Meanwhile came many thoughts : on me</l>
       <l n="50">Rested the hopes of Italy . 50</l>
       <l n="51">I had devised a certain tale</l>
       <l n="52">Which , when ‘ twas told her , could not fail</l>
       <l n="53">Persuade a peasant of its truth ;</l>
       <l n="54">I meant to call a freak of youth</l>
       <l n="55">This hiding , and give hopes of pay ,</l>
       <l n="56">And no temptation to betray .</l>
       <l n="57">But when I saw that woman 's face ,</l>
       <l n="58">Its calm simplicity of grace ,</l>
       <l n="59">Our Italy 's own attitude</l>
       <l n="60">In which she walked thus far , and stood , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Planting each naked foot so firm ,</l>
       <l n="62">To crush the snake and spare the worm —</l>
       <l n="63">At first sight of her eyes , I said ,</l>

       <l n="75">Before the duomo shuts ; go in ,</l>
       <l n="76">And wait till Tenebrae begin ;</l>
       <l n="77">Walk to the third confessional ,</l>

      <head>NOTES : “ The Italian in England . ” An Italian patriot who has taken part in an unsuccessful revolt against Austrian dominance , reflects upon the incidents of his escape and flight from Italy to the end that if he ever should have a thought beyond the welfare of Italy , he would wish first for the discomfiture of his enemies and then to go and see once more the noble woman who at the risk of her own life helped him to escape . Though there is no exact historical incident upon which this poem is founded , it has a historical background . The Charles referred to ( lines 8 , 11 , 20 , 116 , 125 ) is Charles Albert , Prince of Carignano , of the younger branch of the house of Savoy . His having played with the patriot in his youth , as the poem says , is quite possible , for Charles was brought up as a simple citizen in a public school , and one of his chief friends was Alberta Nota , a writer of liberal principles , whom he made his secretary . As indicated in the poem , Charles at first declared himself in sympathy , though in a somewhat lukewarm manner , with the rising led by Santa Rosa against Austrian domination in 1823 , and upon the abdication of Victor Emanuel he became regent of Turin . But when the king Charles Felix issued a denunciation against the new government , Charles Albert succumbed to the king 's threats and left his friends in the lurch . Later the Austrians marched into the country , Santa Rosa was forced to retreat from Turin , and , with his friends , he who might well have been the very patriot of the poem was obliged to fly from Italy .</head>
      <p>19 . Metternich : the distinguished Austrian diplomatist and determined enemy of Italian independence .</p>
      <p n="1">76 . Tenebrae : darkness . “ The office of matins and lauds , for the three last days in Holy Week . Fifteen lighted candles are placed on a triangular stand , and at the conclusion of each psalm one is put out till a single candle is left at the top of the triangle . The extinction of the other candles is said to figure the growing darkness of the world at the time of the Crucifixion . The last candle ( which is not extinguished , but hidden behind the altar for a few moments ) represents Christ , over whom Death could not prevail . ' ’ ( Dr. Berdoe )</p>

       <l n="39">With a bough and a stone ,</l>
       <l n="40">And look thro ’ the twisted dead vine-twigs ,</l>
       <l n="41">Sole lattice that 's known . 40</l>
       <l n="42">Quick and sharp rang the rings down the net-poles ,</l>
       <l n="43">While , busy beneath ,</l>
       <l n="44">Your priest and his brother tugged at them ,</l>
       <l n="45">The rain in their teeth .</l>
       <l n="46">And out upon all the flat house-roofs</l>
       <l n="47">Where split figs lay drying ,</l>
       <l n="48">The girls took the frails under cover :</l>
       <l n="49">Nor use seemed in trying</l>
       <l n="50">To get out the boats and go fishing ,</l>
       <l n="51">For , under the cliff , 50</l>
       <l n="52">Fierce the black water frothed o'er the blind-rock .</l>
       <l n="53">No seeing our skiff</l>
       <l n="54">Arrive about noon from Amalfi ,</l>
       <l n="55">— Our fisher arrive ,</l>
       <l n="56">And pitch down his basket before us ,</l>
       <l n="57">All trembling alive</l>
       <l n="58">With pink and grey jellies , your sea-fruit ;</l>

       <l n="60">And mouths gape there , eyes open , all manner</l>
       <l n="61">Of horns and of humps , 60</l>
       <l n="62">Which only the fisher looks grave at ,</l>
       <l n="63">While round him like imps</l>
       <l n="64">Cling screaming the children as naked</l>
       <l n="65">And brown as his shrimps ;</l>
       <l n="66">Himself too as bare to the middle</l>
       <l n="67">— You see round his neck</l>

       <l n="71">So back , to a man , 70</l>
       <l n="72">Came our friends , with whose help in the vineyards</l>

       <l n="98">With lasagne so tempting to swallow ,</l>
       <l n="99">In slippery ropes ,</l>
       <l n="100">And gourds fried in great purple slices ,</l>

       <l n="157">From the ocean beneath —</l>

      <head>NOTES : “ The Italian in England . ” An Italian patriot who has taken part in an unsuccessful revolt against Austrian dominance , reflects upon the incidents of his escape and flight from Italy to the end that if he ever should have a thought beyond the welfare of Italy , he would wish first for the discomfiture of his enemies and then to go and see once more the noble woman who at the risk of her own life helped him to escape . Though there is no exact historical incident upon which this poem is founded , it has a historical background . The Charles referred to ( lines 8 , 11 , 20 , 116 , 125 ) is Charles Albert , Prince of Carignano , of the younger branch of the house of Savoy . His having played with the patriot in his youth , as the poem says , is quite possible , for Charles was brought up as a simple citizen in a public school , and one of his chief friends was Alberta Nota , a writer of liberal principles , whom he made his secretary . As indicated in the poem , Charles at first declared himself in sympathy , though in a somewhat lukewarm manner , with the rising led by Santa Rosa against Austrian domination in 1823 , and upon the abdication of Victor Emanuel he became regent of Turin . But when the king Charles Felix issued a denunciation against the new government , Charles Albert succumbed to the king 's threats and left his friends in the lurch . Later the Austrians marched into the country , Santa Rosa was forced to retreat from Turin , and , with his friends , he who might well have been the very patriot of the poem was obliged to fly from Italy .</head>
      <p>19 . Metternich : the distinguished Austrian diplomatist and determined enemy of Italian independence .</p>
      <p n="1">76 . Tenebrae : darkness . “ The office of matins and lauds , for the three last days in Holy Week . Fifteen lighted candles are placed on a triangular stand , and at the conclusion of each psalm one is put out till a single candle is left at the top of the triangle . The extinction of the other candles is said to figure the growing darkness of the world at the time of the Crucifixion . The last candle ( which is not extinguished , but hidden behind the altar for a few moments ) represents Christ , over whom Death could not prevail . ' ’ ( Dr. Berdoe )</p>

      <head>NOTES : “ In a Gondola ” is a lyric dialogue between two Venetian lovers who have stolen away in a gondola spite of “ the three ” — “ Himself ’ , ” perhaps a husband , and “ Paul ” and “ Gian , ” her brothers — whose vengeance discovers them at the end , but not before their love and danger have moved them to weave a series of lyrical fancies , and led them to a climax of emotion which makes Life so deep a joy that Death is of no account .</head>

      <head>NOTES : “ Waring . ” In recounting the sudden disappearance from among his friends of a man proud and sensitive , who with fine powers of intellect yet incurred somewhat of disdain because of his failure to accomplish anything permanent , expression is given to the deep regret experienced by his friends now that he has left them , his absence having brought them to a truer realization of his worth . If only Waring would come back , the speaker , at least , would give him the sympathy and encouragement he craved instead of playing with his sensibilities as he had done . Conjectures are indulged in as to Waring 's whereabouts . The speaker prefers to think of him as back in London preparing to astonish the world with some great masterpiece in art , music , or literature . Another speaker surprises all by telling how he had seen the “ last of Waring ” in a momentary meeting at Trieste , but the first speaker is certain that the star of Waring is destined to rise again above their horizon .</head>
      <p>1 . Waring : Alfred Domett ( born at Camberwell Grove , Surrey , May 20 , 1811 ) , a friend of Browning 's , distinguished as a poet and as a Colonial statesman and ruler . His first volume of poems was published in 1832 . Some verses of his in Blackwood 's , 1837 , attracted much attention to him as a rising young poet . In 1841 he was called to the bar , and in 1841 went out to New Zealand among the earliest settlers . There he lived for thirty years , filling several important official positions . His unceremonious departure for New Zealand with no leave-takings was the occasion of Browning 's poem , which is said by Mrs. Orr to give a lifelike sketch of Domett 's character . His “ star ” did , however , rise again for his English friends , for he returned to London in 1871 . The year following saw the publication of his “ Ranolf and Amohia , ” a New Zealand poem , in the course of which he characterizes Browning as “ Subtlest Asserter of the Soul in Song . ” He met Browning again in London , and was one of the vice-presidents of the London Browning Society . Died Nov. 12 , 1877 .</p>
      <p n="1">15 . I left his arm that night myself : George W. Cooke points out that in his Living Authors of England Thomas Powell describes this incident , the “ young author ” mentioned being himself : “ We have a vivid recollection of the last time we saw him . It was at an evening party , a few days before he sailed from England ; his intimate friend , Mr. Browning , was also present . It happened that the latter was introduced that evening for the first time to a young author who had just then appeared in the literary world . This , consequently , prevented the two friends from conversation , and they parted from each other without the slightest idea on Mr. Browning 's part that he was seeing his old friend Domett for the last time . Some days after , when he found that Domett had sailed , he expressed in strong terms to the writer of this sketch the self-reproach he felt at having preferred the conversation of a stranger to that of his old associate . ”</p>
      <p n="2">54 . Monstr ’ - inform ’ - ingens-horrend-ous : a slight transposition of part of a line in Virgil describing Polyphemus , “ Monstrum horrendum informe ingens , ” a monster horrid , misshapen , huge .</p>
      <p n="3">55 . Demoniaco-seraphic : these two lines form a compound of adjectives humorously used by Browning to express the inferiority of the writers he praised to Waring .</p>
      <p n="4">99 . Ichabod : “ Ichabod , the glory is departed . ” I Samuel IV . 21 .</p>
      <p n="5">112. syenite : Egyptian granite</p>
      <p n="6">122 . Lamb-white maiden : Iphigenia , who was borne away to Taurus by Diana , when her father , Agamemnon , was about to sacrifice her to obtain favorable winds for his expedition to Troy .</p>
      <p n="7">152 . Caldara Polidore : Surnamed da Caravaggio . He was born in Milan in 1492 , went to Rome and was employed by Raphael to paint the friezes in the Vatican . He was murdered by a servant in Messina , 1543 .</p>
      <p n="8">155 . Purcell : an eminent English musician , composer of church music , operas , songs , and instrumental music . ( 1658-1695 ) .— Rosy Bowers : One of Purcell 's most celebrated songs . “ ‘ From Rosie Bowers ’ is said to have been set in his last sickness , at which time he seems to have realized the poetical fable of the Swan and to have sung more sweetly as he approached nearer his dissolution , for it seems to us as if no one of his productions was so elevated , so pleasing , so expressive , and throughout so perfect as this ” ( Rees 's Cyclopaedia , 1819 ) .</p>
      <p n="9">190 . Garrick : David , an English actor , celebrated especially for his Shakespearian parts ( 1716-1779 ) .</p>
      <p n="10">193 . Junius : the assumed name of a political writer who in 1769 began to issue in London a series of famous letters which opposed the ministry in power , and denounced several eminent persons with severe invective and pungent sarcasm .</p>
      <p n="11">195 . Some Chatterton shall have the luck of calling Rowley into life : the chief claim to celebrity of Thomas Chatterton ( 1752-1770 ) is the real or pretended discovery of poems said to have been written in the fifteenth century by Thomas Rowley , a priest of Bristol , and found in Radcliffe church , of which Chatterton 's ancestors had been sextons for many years . They are now generally considered Chatterton 's own .</p>

      <head>NOTES : “ A Light Woman ” is the story of a dramatic situation brought about by the speaker 's intermeddling to save his less sophisticated friend from a light woman 's toils . He deflects her interest and wins her heart , and this is the ironical outcome : his friendly , dispassionate act makes him seem to his friend a disloyal passion 's slave ; his scorn of the light woman teaches him her genuineness , and proves himself lighter than she ; his futile assumption of the god manoeuvring souls makes the whole story dramatically imply , in a way dear to Browning 's heart , the sacredness and worth of each individuality .</head>
      <p>[ I cannot agree with Porter and Clarke 's estimate of the speaker 's act as “ friendly , dispassionate . ” They fail to take into account his supercilious attitude toward the man he calls his friend , and he proves to be more self-serving — and more self-deceiving — than they are willing to admit . That is why it is a subject made to Browning 's hand .— [ Transcriber of the PG text ]</p>

      <head>NOTES : “ The Pied Piper of Hamelin . ” This clever versification of a well-known tale was written for the little son of the actor William Macready . According to Dr. Furnivall , the version used directly by Browning is from “ The Wonders of the Little World : or A General History of Man , ” by Nathaniel Wanley , published in 1578 . There are , however , more incidents in common between the poem and the version given by Verstigan in his “ Restitution of Decayed Intelligence ” ( 1605 ) . There are many other sources for the story , and it is not improbable that Browning knew more than one version . Tales similar to it occur also in Persia and China . For its kinship to myths of the wind as a musician , and as a psychopomp or leader of souls , see Baring-Gould , “ Curious Myths of the Middle Ages ” ; John Fiske , “ Myths and Myth-makers ” ; Cox , “ Myths of the Aryan Races . ” — Hamlin , or Hamelin , is a town in the province of Hanover , Prussia .</head>

        <l n="359">Born , no doubt , like insects which breed on</l>
        <l n="360">The very fruit they are meant to feed on . 360</l>
        <l n="361">For the earth-not a use to which they do n't turn it ,</l>
        <l n="362">The ore that grows in the mountain 's womb ,</l>
        <l n="363">Or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb ,</l>
        <l n="364">They sift and soften it , bake it and burn it —</l>
        <l n="365">Whether they weld you , for instance , a snaffle</l>
        <l n="366">With side-bars never a brute can baffle ;</l>
        <l n="367">Or a lock that 's a puzzle of wards within wards ;</l>
        <l n="368">Or , if your colt 's fore-foot inclines to curve inwards ,</l>
        <l n="369">Horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel</l>
        <l n="370">And wo n't allow the hoof to shrivel . 370</l>
        <l n="371">Then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle</l>
        <l n="372">That keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle ;</l>
        <l n="373">But the sand-they pinch and pound it like otters ;</l>
        <l n="374">Commend me to Gipsy glass-makers and potters !</l>
        <l n="375">Glasses they 'll blow you , crystal-clear ,</l>
        <l n="376">Where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear ,</l>
        <l n="377">As if in pure water you dropped and let die</l>
        <l n="378">A bruised black-blooded mulberry ;</l>
        <l n="379">And that other sort , their crowning pride ,</l>
        <l n="380">With long white threads distinct inside , 380</l>
        <l n="381">Like the lake-flower 's fibrous roots which dangle</l>
        <l n="382">Loose such a length and never tangle ,</l>
        <l n="383">Where the bold sword-lily cuts the clear waters ,</l>
        <l n="384">And the cup-lily couches with all the white daughters :</l>
        <l n="385">Such are the works they put their hand to ,</l>
        <l n="386">The uses they turn and twist iron and sand to .</l>
        <l n="387">And these made the troop , which our Duke saw sally</l>
        <l n="388">Toward his castle from out of the valley ,</l>
        <l n="389">Men and women , like new-hatched spiders ,</l>
        <l n="390">Come out with the morning to greet our riders . 390</l>
        <l n="391">And up they wound till they reached the ditch ,</l>
        <l n="392">Whereat all stopped save one , a witch</l>
        <l n="393">That I knew , as she hobbled from the group ,</l>
        <l n="394">By her gait directly and her stoop ,</l>
        <l n="395">I , whom Jacynth was used to importune</l>
        <l n="396">To let that same witch tell us our fortune .</l>
        <l n="397">The oldest Gipsy then above ground ;</l>
        <l n="398">And , sure as the autumn season came round ,</l>
        <l n="399">She paid us a visit for profit or pastime ,</l>
        <l n="400">And every time , as she swore , for the last time . 400</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="15">
        <l n="401">And presently she was seen to sidle</l>
        <l n="402">Up to the Duke till she touched his bridle ,</l>
        <l n="403">So that the horse of a sudden reared up</l>
        <l n="404">As under its nose the old witch peered up</l>
        <l n="405">With her worn-out eyes , or rather eye-holes</l>
        <l n="406">Of no use now but to gather brine ,</l>
        <l n="407">And began a kind of level whine</l>
        <l n="408">Such as they used to sing to their viols</l>
        <l n="409">When their ditties they go grinding</l>
        <l n="410">Up and down with nobody minding 410</l>
        <l n="411">And then , as of old , at the end of the humming</l>
        <l n="412">Her usual presents were forthcoming</l>
        <l n="413">— A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles ,</l>
        <l n="414">( Just a sea-shore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles )</l>
        <l n="415">Or a porcelain mouth-piece to screw on a pipe-end —</l>
        <l n="416">And so she awaited her annual stipend .</l>
        <l n="417">But this time , the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe</l>
        <l n="418">A word in reply ; and in vain she felt</l>
        <l n="419">With twitching fingers at her belt</l>
        <l n="420">For the purse of sleek pine-martin pelt , 420</l>
        <l n="421">Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe —</l>
        <l n="422">Till , either to quicken his apprehension ,</l>
        <l n="423">Or possibly with an after-intention ,</l>
        <l n="424">She was come , she said , to pay her duty</l>
        <l n="425">To the new Duchess , the youthful beauty .</l>
        <l n="426">No sooner had she named his lady ,</l>
        <l n="427">Than a shine lit up the face so shady ,</l>
        <l n="428">And its smirk returned with a novel meaning —</l>
        <l n="429">For it struck him , the babe just wanted weaning ;</l>
        <l n="430">If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow , 430</l>
        <l n="431">She , foolish today , would be wiser tomorrow ;</l>
        <l n="432">And who so fit a teacher of trouble</l>
        <l n="433">As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double ?</l>
        <l n="434">So , glancing at her wolf-skin vesture ,</l>
        <l n="435">( If such it was , for they grow so hirsute</l>
        <l n="436">That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit )</l>
        <l n="437">He was contrasting , ‘ twas plain from his gesture ,</l>
        <l n="438">The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate</l>
        <l n="439">With the loathsome squalor of this helicat .</l>
        <l n="440">I , in brief , was the man the Duke beckoned 440</l>
        <l n="441">From out of the throng , and while I drew near</l>
        <l n="442">He told the crone-as I since have reckoned</l>
        <l n="443">By the way he bent and spoke into her ear</l>
        <l n="444">With circumspection and mystery —</l>
        <l n="445">The main of the lady 's history ,</l>
        <l n="446">Her frowardness and ingratitude :</l>
        <l n="447">And for all the crone 's submissive attitude</l>
        <l n="448">I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening ,</l>
        <l n="449">And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening</l>
        <l n="450">As though she engaged with hearty goodwill 450</l>
        <l n="451">Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfil ,</l>
        <l n="452">And promised the lady a thorough frightening .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="16">
        <l n="453">And so , just giving her a glimpse</l>
        <l n="454">Of a purse , with the air of a man who imps</l>
        <l n="455">The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw ,</l>
        <l n="456">He bade me take the Gipsy mother</l>
        <l n="457">And set her telling some story or other</l>
        <l n="458">Of hill or dale , oak-wood or fernshaw ,</l>
        <l n="459">To wile away a weary hour</l>
        <l n="460">For the lady left alone in her bower , 460</l>
        <l n="461">Whose mind and body craved exertion</l>
        <l n="462">And yet shrank from all better diversion .</l>

        <l n="463">Then clapping heel to his horse , the mere curveter ,</l>
        <l n="464">Out rode the Duke , and after his hollo</l>
        <l n="465">Horses and hounds swept , huntsman and servitor ,</l>
        <l n="466">And back I turned and bade the crone follow .</l>
        <l n="467">And what makes me confident what 's to be told you</l>
        <l n="468">Had all along been of this crone 's devising ,</l>
        <l n="469">Is , that , on looking round sharply , behold you ,</l>
        <l n="470">There was a novelty quick as surprising : 470</l>
        <l n="471">For first , she had shot up a full head in stature ,</l>
        <l n="472">And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered ,</l>
        <l n="473">As if age had foregone its usurpature ,</l>
        <l n="474">And the ignoble mien was wholly altered ,</l>
        <l n="475">And the face looked quite of another nature ,</l>
        <l n="476">And the change reached too , whatever the change meant ,</l>
        <l n="477">Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak 's arrangement :</l>
        <l n="478">For where its tatters hung loose like sedges ,</l>
        <l n="479">Gold coins were glittering on the edges ,</l>
        <l n="480">Like the band-roll strung with tomans 480</l>
        <l n="481">Which proves the veil a Persian woman 's :</l>
        <l n="482">And under her brow , like a snail 's horns newly</l>
        <l n="483">Come out as after the rain he paces ,</l>
        <l n="484">Two unmistakeable eye-points duly</l>
        <l n="485">Live and aware looked out of their places .</l>
        <l n="486">So , we went and found Jacynth at the entry</l>
        <l n="487">Of the lady 's chamber standing sentry ;</l>
        <l n="488">I told the command and produced my companion ,</l>
        <l n="489">And Jacynth rejoiced to admit any one ,</l>
        <l n="490">For since last night , by the same token , 490</l>
        <l n="491">Not a single word had the lady spoken :</l>
        <l n="492">They went in both to the presence together ,</l>
        <l n="493">While I in the balcony watched the weather .</l>

        <l n="494">And now , what took place at the very first of all ,</l>
        <l n="495">I cannot tell , as I never could learn it :</l>
        <l n="496">Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall</l>
        <l n="497">On that little head of hers and burn it</l>
        <l n="498">If she knew how she came to drop so soundly</l>
        <l n="499">Asleep of a sudden and there continue</l>
        <l n="500">The whole time sleeping as profoundly 500</l>
        <l n="501">As one of the boars my father would pin you</l>
        <l n="502">‘ Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison ,</l>
        <l n="503">— Jacynth forgive me the comparison !</l>
        <l n="504">But where I begin my own narration</l>
        <l n="505">Is a little after I took my station</l>
        <l n="506">To breathe the fresh air from the balcony ,</l>
        <l n="507">And , having in those days a falcon eye ,</l>
        <l n="508">To follow the hunt thro ’ the open country ,</l>
        <l n="509">From where the bushes thinlier crested</l>
        <l n="510">The hillocks , to a plain where 's not one tree . 510</l>
        <l n="511">When , in a moment , my ear was arrested</l>
        <l n="512">By — was it singing , or was it saying ,</l>
        <l n="513">Or a strange musical instrument playing</l>
        <l n="514">In the chamber ?— and to be certain</l>
        <l n="515">I pushed the lattice , pulled the curtain ,</l>
        <l n="516">And there lay Jacynth asleep ,</l>
        <l n="517">Yet as if a watch she tried to keep ,</l>
        <l n="518">In a rosy sleep along the floor</l>
        <l n="519">With her head against the door ;</l>
        <l n="520">While in the midst , on the seat of state , 520</l>
        <l n="521">Was a queen-the Gipsy woman late ,</l>
        <l n="522">With head and face downbent</l>
        <l n="523">On the lady 's head and face intent :</l>
        <l n="524">For , coiled at her feet like a child at ease ,</l>
        <l n="525">The lady sat between her knees</l>
        <l n="526">And o'er them the lady 's clasped hands met ,</l>
        <l n="527">And on those hands her chin was set ,</l>
        <l n="528">And her upturned face met the face of the crone</l>
        <l n="529">Wherein the eyes had grown and grown</l>
        <l n="530">As if she could double and quadruple 530</l>
        <l n="531">At pleasure the play of either pupil</l>
        <l n="532">— Very like , by her hands ’ slow fanning ,</l>
        <l n="533">As up and down like a gor-crow 's flappers</l>
        <l n="534">They moved to measure , or bell-clappers .</l>
        <l n="535">I said , “ Is it blessing , is it banning ,</l>
        <l n="536">Do they applaud you or burlesque you —</l>
        <l n="537">Those hands and fingers with no flesh on ? ”</l>
        <l n="538">But , just as I thought to spring in to the rescue ,</l>
        <l n="539">At once I was stopped by the lady 's expression :</l>
        <l n="540">For it was life her eyes were drinking 540</l>
        <l n="541">From the crone 's wide pair above unwinking ,</l>
        <l n="542">— Life 's pure fire received without shrinking ,</l>
        <l n="543">Into the heart and breast whose heaving</l>
        <l n="544">Told you no single drop they were leaving ,</l>
        <l n="545">— Life , that filling her , passed redundant</l>
        <l n="546">Into her very hair , back swerving</l>
        <l n="547">Over each shoulder , loose and abundant ,</l>
        <l n="548">As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving ;</l>
        <l n="549">And the very tresses shared in the pleasure ,</l>
        <l n="550">Moving to the mystic measure , 550</l>
        <l n="551">Bounding as the bosom bounded .</l>
        <l n="552">I stopped short , more and more confounded ,</l>
        <l n="553">As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened ,</l>
        <l n="554">As she listened and she listened :</l>
        <l n="555">When all at once a hand detained me ,</l>
        <l n="556">The selfsame contagion gained me ,</l>
        <l n="557">And I kept time to the wondrous chime ,</l>
        <l n="558">Making out words and prose and rhyme ,</l>
        <l n="559">Till it seemed that the music furled</l>
        <l n="560">Its wings like a task fulfilled , and dropped 560</l>
        <l n="561">From under the words it first had propped ,</l>
        <l n="562">And left them midway in the world :</l>
        <l n="563">Word took word as hand takes hand</l>
        <l n="564">I could hear at last , and understand ,</l>
        <l n="565">And when I held the unbroken thread ,</l>
        <l n="566">The Gipsy said :</l>
        <l n="567">“ And so at last we find my tribe .</l>
        <l n="568">And so I set thee in the midst ,</l>
        <l n="569">And to one and all of them describe</l>
        <l n="570">What thou saidst and what thou didst , 570</l>
        <l n="571">Our long and terrible journey through ,</l>
        <l n="572">And all thou art ready to say and do</l>
        <l n="573">In the trials that remain :</l>
        <l n="574">I trace them the vein and the other vein</l>
        <l n="575">That meet on thy brow and part again ,</l>
        <l n="576">Making our rapid mystic mark ;</l>
        <l n="577">And I bid my people prove and probe</l>
        <l n="578">Each eye 's profound and glorious globe</l>
        <l n="579">Till they detect the kindred spark</l>
        <l n="580">In those depths so dear and dark , 580</l>
        <l n="581">Like the spots that snap and burst and flee ,</l>
        <l n="582">Circling over the midnight sea .</l>
        <l n="583">And on that round young cheek of thine</l>
        <l n="584">I make them recognize the tinge ,</l>
        <l n="585">As when of the costly scarlet wine</l>
        <l n="586">They drip so much as will impinge</l>
        <l n="587">And spread in a thinnest scale afloat</l>
        <l n="588">One thick gold drop from the olive 's coat</l>
        <l n="589">Over a silver plate whose sheen</l>
        <l n="590">Still thro ’ the mixture shall be seen . 590</l>
        <l n="591">For so I prove thee , to one and all ,</l>
        <l n="592">Fit , when my people ope their breast ,</l>
        <l n="593">To see the sign , and hear the call ,</l>
        <l n="594">And take the vow , and stand the test</l>
        <l n="595">Which adds one more child to the rest —</l>
        <l n="596">When the breast is bare and the arms are wide ,</l>
        <l n="597">And the world is left outside .</l>

        <l n="601">If that brow is true and those eyes are sure ;</l>

        <l n="624">Or the climbing plant that seeks the tree —</l>
        <l n="625">Canst thou help us , must we help thee ?</l>
        <l n="626">If any two creatures grew into one ,</l>
        <l n="627">They would do more than the world has done :</l>

        <l n="637">Up and about , with blossoms and leaves ?</l>
        <l n="638">Fix his heart 's fruit for thy garland-crown ,</l>
        <l n="639">Cling with his soul as the gourd-vine cleaves ,</l>
        <l n="640">Die on thy boughs and disappear 640</l>
        <l n="641">While not a leaf of thine is sere ?</l>
        <l n="642">Or is the other fate in store ,</l>

        <l n="645">And take a stronger nature 's sway ?</l>
        <l n="646">I foresee and could foretell</l>
        <l n="647">Thy future portion , sure and well :</l>
        <l n="648">But those passionate eyes speak true , speak true ,</l>
        <l n="649">Let them say what thou shalt do !</l>
        <l n="650">Only be sure thy daily life , 650</l>
        <l n="651">In its peace or in its strife ,</l>
        <l n="652">Never shall be unobserved ;</l>

        <l n="661">For the good of us all , where the haters meet</l>
        <l n="662">In the crowded city 's horrible street ;</l>
        <l n="663">Or thou step alone through the morass</l>
        <l n="664">Where never sound yet was</l>
        <l n="665">Save the dry quick clap of the stork 's bill ,</l>
        <l n="666">For the air is still , and the water still ,</l>
        <l n="667">When the blue breast of the dipping coot</l>
        <l n="668">Dives under , and all is mute .</l>
        <l n="669">So , at the last shall come old age ,</l>
        <l n="670">Decrepit as befits that stage ; 670</l>
        <l n="671">How else wouldst thou retire apart</l>
        <l n="672">With the hoarded memories of thy heart ,</l>
        <l n="673">And gather all to the very least</l>
        <l n="674">Of the fragments of life 's earlier feast ,</l>

        <l n="710">I knew the crone was bewitching my lady ,</l>
        <l n="711">With Jacynth asleep ; and but one spring made I 710</l>
        <l n="712">Down from the casement , round to the portal ,</l>
        <l n="713">Another minute and I had entered —</l>
        <l n="714">When the door opened , and more than mortal</l>
        <l n="715">Stood , with a face where to my mind centred</l>
        <l n="716">All beauties I ever saw or shall see ,</l>
        <l n="717">The Duchess : I stopped as if struck by palsy .</l>
        <l n="718">She was so different , happy and beautiful ,</l>
        <l n="719">I felt at once that all was best ,</l>
        <l n="720">And that I had nothing to do , for the rest</l>
        <l n="721">But wait her commands , obey and be dutiful . 720</l>
        <l n="722">Not that , in fact , there was any commanding ;</l>
        <l n="723">I saw the glory of her eye ,</l>
        <l n="724">And the brow 's height and the breast 's expanding ,</l>
        <l n="725">And I was hers to live or to die .</l>
        <l n="726">As for finding what she wanted ,</l>
        <l n="727">You know God Almighty granted</l>
        <l n="728">Such little signs should serve wild creatures</l>
        <l n="729">To tell one another all their desires ,</l>
        <l n="730">So that each knows what his friend requires ,</l>
        <l n="731">And does its bidding without teachers . 730</l>
        <l n="732">I preceded her ; the crone</l>
        <l n="733">Followed silent and alone ;</l>
        <l n="734">I spoke to her , but she merely jabbered</l>
        <l n="735">In the old style ; both her eyes had slunk</l>
        <l n="736">Back to their pits ; her stature shrunk ;</l>
        <l n="737">In short , the soul in its body sunk</l>
        <l n="738">Like a blade sent home to its scabbard .</l>
        <l n="739">We descended , I preceding ;</l>
        <l n="740">Crossed the court with nobody heeding ;</l>
        <l n="741">All the world was at the chase , 740</l>
        <l n="742">The courtyard like a desert-place ,</l>
        <l n="743">The stable emptied of its small fry ;</l>
        <l n="744">I saddled myself the very palfrey</l>
        <l n="745">I remember patting while it carried her ,</l>
        <l n="746">The day she arrived and the Duke married her .</l>
        <l n="747">And , do you know , though it 's easy deceiving</l>
        <l n="748">Oneself in such matters , I can n't help believing</l>
        <l n="749">The lady had not forgotten it either ,</l>
        <l n="750">And knew the poor devil so much beneath her</l>
        <l n="751">Would have been only too glad for her service 750</l>
        <l n="752">To dance on hot ploughshares like a Turk dervise ,</l>
        <l n="753">But , unable to pay proper duty where owing</l>
        <l n="754">Was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it :</l>
        <l n="755">For though the moment I began setting</l>
        <l n="756">His saddle on my own nag of Berold 's begetting ,</l>
        <l n="757">( Not that I meant to be obtrusive )</l>
        <l n="758">She stopped me , while his rug was shifting ,</l>
        <l n="759">By a single rapid finger 's lifting ,</l>
        <l n="760">And , with a gesture kind but conclusive ,</l>
        <l n="761">And a little shake of the head , refused me — 760</l>
        <l n="762">I say , although she never used me ,</l>
        <l n="763">Yet when she was mounted , the Gipsy behind her ,</l>
        <l n="764">And I ventured to remind her</l>
        <l n="765">I suppose with a voice of less steadiness</l>
        <l n="766">Than usual , for my feeling exceeded me ,</l>
        <l n="767">— Something to the effect that I was in readiness</l>
        <l n="768">Whenever God should please she needed me —</l>
        <l n="769">Then , do you know , her face looked down on me</l>
        <l n="770">With a look that placed a crown on me ,</l>
        <l n="771">And she felt in her bosom — mark , her bosom — 770</l>
        <l n="772">And , as a flower-tree drops its blossom ,</l>
        <l n="773">Dropped me ... ah , had it been a purse</l>
        <l n="774">Of silver , my friend , or gold that 's worse ,</l>
        <l n="775">Why , you see , as soon as I found myself</l>
        <l n="776">So understood ,— that a true heart so may gain</l>
        <l n="777">Such a reward ,— I should have gone home again ,</l>
        <l n="778">Kissed Jacynth , and soberly drowned myself !</l>
        <l n="779">It was a little plait of hair</l>
        <l n="780">Such as friends in a convent make</l>
        <l n="781">To wear , each for the other 's sake — 780</l>
        <l n="782">This , see , which at my breast I wear ,</l>
        <l n="783">Ever did ( rather to Jacynth 's grudgment ) ,</l>
        <l n="784">And ever shall , till the Day of Judgment .</l>
        <l n="785">And then-and then — to cut short — this is idle ,</l>
        <l n="786">These are feelings it is not good to foster —</l>
        <l n="787">I pushed the gate wide , she shook the bridle ,</l>
        <l n="788">And the palfrey bounded — and so we lost her .</l>

        <l n="857">And I , as he says , but a serf and thrall .</l>
        <l n="858">My father was born here , and I inherit</l>
        <l n="859">His fame , a chain he bound his son with ;</l>
        <l n="860">Could I pay in a lump I should prefer it ,</l>
        <l n="861">But there 's no mine to blow up and get done with : 860</l>
        <l n="862">So , I must stay till the end of the chapter .</l>

    <head>NOTES : “ The Flight of the Duchess . ” A story of the triumph of a free and loving life over a cold and conventional one . The duke 's huntsman frees his mind to his friend as to his part in the escape of the gladsome , ardent young duchess from the blighting yoke of a husband whose life consisted in imitating defunct mediaeval customs . An old gipsy is the agency that awakens her to the joy and freedom of love . Her mystic chant and charm claim the duchess as the true heir of gipsy blood , thrill her with life , half-hypnotize the huntsman , too , and seem to transform the gipsy crone herself into an Eastern queen . He helps them off , and looks for no better future , when the duke 's death releases him , than to travel to the land of the gipsies and hear the last news of his lady .</head>
    <p n="1">The poem grew from the fancies aroused in the poet 's heart by the snatch of a woman 's song he overheard when a boy — “ Following the Queen of the Gipsies , O ! ”</p>
    <p n="2">A GRAMMARIAN 'S FUNERAL ,</p>
    <p n="3">SHORTLY AFTER THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN EUROPE</p>
    <p n="4">Let us begin and carry up this corpse , Singing together . Leave we the common crofts , the vulgar thorpes Each in its tether Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain , Cared-for till cock-crow : Look out if yonder be not day again Rimming the rock-row ! That 's the appropriate country ; there , man 's thought , Rarer , intenser , 10 Self-gathered for an outbreak , as it ought , Chafes in the censer . Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop ; Seek we sepulture On a tall mountain , citied to the top , Crowded with culture ! All the peaks soar , but one the rest excels ; Clouds overcome it ; No ! Yonder sparkle is the citadel 's Circling its summit . 20 Thither our path lies ; wind we up the heights : Wait ye the warning ? Our low life was the level 's and the night 's ; He 's for the morning . Step to a tune , square chests , erect each head , ‘ Ware the beholders ! This is our master , famous calm and dead , Borne on our shoulders .</p>
    <p n="5">Sleep , crop and herd ! sleep , darkling thorpe and croft , Safe from the weather ! 30 He , whom we convoy to his grave aloft , Singing together , He was a man born with thy face and throat , Lyric Apollo !</p>
    <p n="6">Long he lived nameless : how should spring take note Winter would follow ? Till lo , the little touch , and youth was gone ! Cramped and diminished , Moaned he , “ New measures , other feet anon ! My dance is finished ? ” 40 No , that 's the world 's way : ( keep the mountain-side , Make for the city ! ) He knew the signal , and stepped on with pride Over men 's pity ; Left play for work , and grappled with the world Bent on escaping : “ What 's in the scroll , ” quoth he , “ thou keepest furled ? Show me their shaping Theirs who most studied man , the bard and sage , Give ! ” — So , he gowned him , 50 Straight got by heart that book to its last page : Learned , we found him . Yea , but we found him bald too , eyes like lead , Accents uncertain : “ Time to taste life , ” another would have said , “ Up with the curtain ! ” This man said rather , “ Actual life comes next ? Patience a moment ! Grant I have mastered learning 's crabbed text , Still there 's the comment . 60 Let me know all ! Prate not of most or least , Painful or easy ! Even to the crumbs I 'd fain eat up the feast , Ay , nor feel queasy . ” Oh , such a life as he resolved to live , When he had learned it , When he had gathered all books had to give ! Sooner , he spurned it . Image the whole , then execute the parts — Fancy the fabric 70 Quite , ere you build , ere steel strike fire from quartz , Ere mortar dab brick !</p>
    <p n="7">( Here 's the town-gate reached : there 's the market-place Gaping before us . ) Yea , this in him was the peculiar grace ( Hearten our chorus ! ) That before living he 'd learn how to live — No end to learning : Earn the means first-God surely will contrive Use for our earning . 80 Others mistrust and say , “ But time escapes : Live now or never ! ” He said , “ What 's time ? Leave Now for dogs and apes ! Man has Forever . ” Back to his book then : deeper drooped his head : Calculus racked him :</p>
    <p n="8">Leaden before , his eyes grew dross of lead : Tussis attacked him . “ Now , master , take a little rest ! ” — not he ! ( Caution redoubled , 90 Step two abreast , the way winds narrowly ! ) Not a whit troubled Back to his studies , fresher than at first , Fierce as a dragon He ( soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst ) Sucked at the flagon . Oh , if we draw a circle premature , Heedless of far gain , Greedy for quick returns of profit , sure Bad is our bargain ! 100 Was it not great ? did not he throw on God , ( He loves the burthen ) God 's task to make the heavenly period Perfect the earthen ? Did not he magnify the mind , show clear Just what it all meant ? He would not discount life , as fools do here , Paid by instalment . He ventured neck or nothing-heaven 's success Found , or earth 's failure : 110 “ Wilt thou trust death or not ? ” He answered “ Yes : Hence with life 's pale lure ! ” That low man seeks a little thing to do , Sees it and does it : This high man , with a great thing to pursue , Dies ere he knows it . That low man goes on adding one to one , His hundred 's soon hit : This high man , aiming at a million , Misses an unit . 120 That , has the world here-should he need the next , Let the world mind him ! This , throws himself on God , and unperplexed Seeking shall find him . So , with the throttling hands of death at strife , Ground he at grammar ; Still , thro ’ the rattle , parts of speech were rife : While he could stammer He settled Hoti 's business — let it be !— Properly based Oun — 130 Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De , Dead from the waist down . Well , here 's the platform , here 's the proper place : Hail to your purlieus , All ye highfliers of the feathered race , Swallows and curlews ! Here 's the top-peak ; the multitude below Live , for they can , there :</p>
    <p n="9">This man decided not to Live but Know — Bury this man there ? 140 Here — here 's his place , where meteors shoot , clouds form , Lightnings are loosened , Stars come and go ! Let joy break with the storm , Peace let the dew send ! Lofty designs must close in like effects : Loftily Iying , Leave him — still loftier than the world suspects , Living and dying .</p>
    <p n="10">NOTES : “ A Grammarian 's Funeral ” is an elegy of a typical pioneer scholar of the Renaissance period , sung by the leader of the chorus of disciples , and interspersed with parenthetical directions to them , while they all bear the body of their master to its appropriate burial-place on the highest mountain-peak . A humorous sense of disproportion in the labors of devoted scholarship to its results heightens their exaltation of the dead humanist 's indomitable trust in the supremacy of the immaterial .</p>

That this is not to be confounded with the accentuated ‘ De , meaning but , ’ was the ‘ Doctrine ’ which the Grammarian bequeathed to those capable of receiving it . ”</p>

    <p n="59">NOTES : “ The Heretic 's Tragedy ” is an Interlude imagined in the manner of the Middle Ages , and typically representing this period of human development in its quaint piety and prejudice , its childish delight in cruelty , and its cumulative legend-making during the course of two centuries as reflected through the Flemish nature . It is supposed to be sung by an abbot , a choir-singer , and a chorus , in celebration of the burning of Jacques du Bourg-Molay , last Grand Master of the wealthy and powerful secular order of Knights Templar , which came into rivalry with the Church after the Crusades and was finally suppressed by Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V , Molay 's burning at Paris in 1314 being a final scene in their discomfiture and the Church 's triumph .</p>
    <p n="60">8 . Plagal-cadence : a closing progression of chords in which the sub-dominant or chord on the fourth degree of the scale precedes the tonic or chord on the first degree of the scale .

    <p n="67">HOLY-CROSS DAY</p>
    <p n="68">ON WHICH THE JEWS WERE FORCED TO ATTEND AN ANNUAL CHRISTIAN SERMON IN ROME</p>
    <p n="69">[ ” Now was come about Holy-Cross Day , and now must my lord preach his first sermon to the Jews : as it was of old cared for in the merciful bowels of the Church , that , so to speak , a crumb at least from her conspicuous table here in Rome should be , though but once yearly , cast to the famishing dogs , under-trampled and bespitten-upon beneath the feet of the guests . And a moving sight in truth , this , of so many of the besotted blind restif and ready-to-perish Hebrews ! now maternally brought-nay ( for He saith , ‘ Compel them to come in ’ ) haled , as it were , by the head and hair , and against their obstinate hearts , to partake of the heavenly grace . What awakening , what striving with tears , what working of a yeasty conscience ! Nor was my lord wanting to himself on so apt an occasion ; witness the abundance of conversions which did incontinently reward him : though not to my lord be altogether the glory . ” -Diary by the Bishop 's Secretary , 1600 . ]</p>
    <p n="70">What the Jews really said , on thus being driven to church , was rather to this effect :—</p>
    <p n="71">I</p>
    <p n="72">Fee , faw , fum ! bubble and squeak ! Blessedest Thursday 's the fat of the week . Rumble and tumble , sleek and rough , Stinking and savoury , smug and gruff , Take the church-road , for the bell 's due chime Gives us the summons — ‘ tis sermon-time !</p>
    <p n="73">II</p>
    <p n="74">Boh , here 's Barnabas ! Job , that 's you ? Up stumps Solomon — bustling too ? Shame , man ! greedy beyond your years To handsel the bishop 's shaving-shears ? Fair play 's a jewel ! Leave friends in the lurch ? 10 Stand on a line ere you start for the church !</p>
    <p n="75">III</p>
    <p n="76">Higgledy piggledy , packed we lie , Rats in a hamper , swine in a stye , Wasps in a bottle , frogs in a sieve , Worms in a carcase , fleas in a sleeve . Hist ! square shoulders , settle your thumbs And buzz for the bishop — here he comes .</p>
    <p n="77">IV</p>
    <p n="78">Bow , wow , wow — a bone for the dog ! I liken his Grace to an acorned hog . 20 What , a boy at his side , with the bloom of a lass , To help and handle my lord 's hour-glass ! Didst ever behold so lithe a chine ? His cheek hath laps like a fresh-singed swine .</p>
    <p n="79">V</p>
    <p n="80">Aaron 's asleep — shove hip to haunch , Or somebody deal him a dig in the paunch ! Look at the purse with the tassel and knob And the gown with the angel and thingumbob ! What 's he at , quotha ? reading his text ! Now you 've his curtsey — and what comes next ? 30</p>
    <p n="81">VI</p>
    <p n="82">See to our converts — you doomed black dozen — No stealing away — nor cog nor cozen ! You five , that were thieves , deserve it fairly ; You seven , that were beggars , will live less sparely ; You took your turn and dipped in the hat , Got fortune — and fortune gets you ; mind that !</p>
    <p n="83">VII</p>
    <p n="84">Give your first groan — compunction 's at work And soft ! from a Jew you mount to a Turk . Lo , Micah ,— the selfsame beard on chin He was four times already converted in ! 40 Here 's a knife , clip quick — it 's a sign of grace — Or he ruins us all with his hanging-face .</p>
    <p n="85">VIII</p>
    <p n="86">Whom now is the bishop a-leering at ? I know a point where his text falls pat . I 'll tell him to-morrow , a word just now Went to my heart and made me vow I meddle no more with the worst of trades — Let somebody else pay his serenades .</p>
    <p n="87">IX</p>
    <p n="88">Groan all together now , whee-hee-hee ! It 's a-work , it 's a-work , ah , woe is me ! 50 It began , when a herd of us , picked and placed , Were spurred through the Corso , stripped to the waist ; Jew brutes , with sweat and blood well spent To usher in worthily Christian Lent .</p>
    <p n="89">X</p>
    <p n="90">It grew , when the hangman entered our bounds , Yelled , pricked us out to his church like hounds : It got to a pitch , when the hand indeed Which gutted my purse would throttle my creed : And it overflows when , to even the odd , Men I helped to their sins help me to their God . 60</p>
    <p n="91">XI</p>
    <p n="92">But now , while the scapegoats leave our flock , And the rest sit silent and count the clock , Since forced to muse the appointed time On these precious facts and truths sublime , Let us fitly employ it , under our breath , In saying Ben Ezra 's Song of Death .</p>
    <p n="93">XII</p>
    <p n="94">For Rabbi Ben Ezra , the night he died , Called sons and sons ’ sons to his side , And spoke , “ This world has been harsh and strange ; Something is wrong : there needeth change . 70 But what , or where ? at the last or first ? In one point only we sinned , at worst .</p>
    <p n="95">XIII</p>
    <p n="96">“ The Lord will have mercy on Jacob yet , And again in his border see Israel set . When Judah beholds Jerusalem , The stranger-seed shall be joined to them : To Jacob 's House shall the Gentiles cleave . So the Prophet saith and his sons believe .</p>
    <p n="97">XIV</p>
    <p n="98">“ Ay , the children of the chosen race Shall carry and bring them to their place : 80 In the land of the Lord shall lead the same Bondsmen and handmaids . Who shall blame , When the slaves enslave , the oppressed ones o'er The oppressor triumph for evermore ?</p>
    <p n="99">XV</p>
    <p n="100">“ God spoke , and gave us the word to keep , Bade never fold the hands nor sleep ‘ Mid a faithless world , at watch and ward , Till Christ at the end relieve our guard . By His servant Moses the watch was set : Though near upon cock-crow , we keep it yet . 90</p>
    <p n="101">XVI</p>
    <p n="102">“ Thou ! if thou wast He , who at mid-watch came , By the starlight , naming a dubious name ! And if , too heavy with sleep — too rash With fear — O Thou , if that martyr-gash Fell on Thee coming to take thine own , And we gave the Cross , when we owed the Throne —</p>
    <p n="103">XVII</p>
    <p n="104">“ Thou art the Judge . We are bruised thus . But , the Judgment over , join sides with us ! Thine too is the cause ! and not more thine Than ours , is the work of these dogs and swine , 100 Whose life laughs through and spits at their creed ! Who maintain Thee in word , and defy Thee in deed !</p>
    <p n="105">XVIII</p>
    <p n="106">“ We withstood Christ then ? Be mindful how At least we withstand Barabbas now ! Was our outrage sore ? But the worst we spared , To have called these — Christians , had we dared ! Let defiance to them pay mistrust of Thee , And Rome make amends for Calvary !</p>
    <p n="107">XIX</p>
    <p n="108">“ By the torture , prolonged from age to age , By the infamy , Israel 's heritage , 110 By the Ghetto 's plague , by the garb 's disgrace , By the badge of shame , by the felon 's place , By the branding-tool , the bloody whip , And the summons to Christian fellowship ,—</p>
    <p n="109">XX</p>
    <p n="110">“ We boast our proof that at least the Jew Would wrest Christ 's name from the Devil 's crew . Thy face took never so deep a shade But we fought them in it , God our aid ! A trophy to bear , as we march , thy band , South , East , and on to the Pleasant Land ! ” 120</p>
    <p n="111">[ Pope Gregory XVI abolished this bad business of the Sermon . — R . B . ]</p>
    <p n="112">NOTES : “ Holy-Cross Day ” reflects the attitude of the corrupt mediaeval Christians and Jews toward each other . The prose preceding the poem gives the point of view of an imaginary Bishop 's Secretary , who congratulates himself upon the good work the Church is doing in forcing its doctrine on the Jews in the Holy-Cross Day sermon , and effecting many conversions . The poem shows that the Jews regard this solicitude on the part of the Christians with hatred and scorn , and that their conversions are in derision of their would-be converters . The sarcasm of the speaker reaches a pinnacle of bitterness when he accuses the Christian bishops of being men he had helped to their sins and who now help him to their God . From scorn toward such followers of Christ , he passes , in the contemplation of Rabbi Ben Ezra 's death song , to a defence of Christ against these followers who profess but do not act his precepts , and a hope that if the Jews were mistaken in not accepting Christ , the tortures they now suffer will be received as expiation for their sin .</p>
    <p n="113">Holy-Cross Day is September 14 . The discovery of the true cross by Saint Helen inaugurated the festival , celebrated both by Latins and Greeks as early as the fifth or sixth century , under the title of the Exaltation of the Cross and later in commemoration of the alleged miraculous appearance of the Cross to Constantine in the sky at midday . Though the particular incidents of the poem are not historical , it is a fact ( see Milman 's “ History of the Jews'’ ) that , by a Papal Bull issued by Gregory XIII in 1584 , all Jews above the age of twelve years were compelled to listen every week to a sermon from a Christian priest .</p>

    <p n="119">Now , read here . “ Protus ends a period Of empery beginning with a god ; Born in the porphyry chamber at Byzant , 10 Queens by his cradle , proud and ministrant : And if he quickened breath there , ‘ twould like fire Pantingly through the dim vast realm transpire . A fame that he was missing spread afar : The world from its four corners , rose in war , Till he was borne out on a balcony To pacify the world when it should see . The captains ranged before him , one , his hand Made baby points at , gained the chief command . And day by day more beautiful he grew 20 In shape , all said , in feature and in hue , While young Greek sculptors , gazing on the child , Became with old Greek sculpture reconciled . Already sages laboured to condense In easy tomes a life 's experience : And artists took grave counsel to impart In one breath and one hand-sweep , all their art , To make his graces prompt as blossoming Of plentifully-watered palms in spring : Since well beseems it , whoso mounts the throne , 30 For beauty , knowledge , strength , should stand alone , And mortals love the letters of his name . ”</p>
    <p n="120">— Stop ! Have you turned two pages ? Still the same . New reign , same date . The scribe goes on to say How that same year , on such a month and day , “ John the Pannonian , groundedly believed A blacksmith 's bastard , whose hard hand reprieved The Empire from its fate the year before , Came , had a mind to take the crown , and wore The same for six years ( during which the Huns 40 Kept off their fingers from us ) , till his sons Put something in his liquor ” — and so forth . Then a new reign . Stay — “ Take at its just worth ” ( Subjoins an annotator ) “ what I give As hearsay . Some think , John let Protus live And slip away . ‘ Tis said , he reached man 's age At some blind northern court ; made , first a page , Then tutor to the children ; last , of use About the hunting-stables . I deduce He wrote the little tract ‘ On worming dogs , ’ 50 Whereof the name in sundry catalogues Is extant yet . A Protus of the race Is rumoured to have died a monk in Thrace , And if the same , he reached senility . ”</p>
    <p n="121">Here 's John the Smith 's rough-hammered head . Great eye , Gross jaw and griped lips do what granite can To give you the crown-grasper . What a man !</p>
    <p n="122">NOTES : “ Protus ” sets in contrast the representations by artist and annalist of the two busts and the two lives of Protus , the baby emperor of Byzantium , born in the purple , gently nurtured and cherished , yet fated to obscurity , and of John , the blacksmith 's bastard , predestined to usurp his throne and save the empire with his harder hand .</p>
    <p n="123">THE STATUE AND THE BUST</p>
    <p n="124">There 's a palace in Florence , the world knows well , And a statue watches it from the square , And this story of both do our townsmen tell .</p>
    <p n="125">Ages ago , a lady there , At the farthest window facing the East Asked , “ Who rides by with the royal air ? ”</p>
    <p n="126">The bridesmaids ’ prattle around her ceased ; She leaned forth , one on either hand ; They saw how the blush of the bride increased —</p>
    <p n="127">They felt by its beats her heart expand — 10 As one at each ear and both in a breath Whispered , “ The Great-Duke Ferdinand . ”</p>
    <p n="128">That self-same instant , underneath , The Duke rode past in his idle way , Empty and fine like a swordless sheath .</p>
    <p n="129">Gay he rode , with a friend as gay , Till he threw his head back — “ Who is she ? ” “ A bride the Riccardi brings home to-day . ”</p>
    <p n="130">Hair in heaps lay heavily Over a pale brow spirit-pure — 20 Carved like the heart of a coal-black tree ,</p>
    <p n="131">Crisped like a war-steed 's encolure — And vainly sought to dissemble her eyes Of the blackest black our eyes endure .</p>
    <p n="132">And lo , a blade for a knight 's emprise Filled the fine empty sheath of a man — The Duke grew straightway brave and wise .</p>
    <p n="133">He looked at her , as a lover can ; She looked at him , as one who awakes : The past was a sleep , and her life began . 30</p>
    <p n="134">Now , love so ordered for both their sakes , A feast was held that selfsame night In the pile which the mighty shadow makes .</p>
    <p n="135">( For Via Larga is three-parts light , But the palace overshadows one , Because of a crime which may God requite !</p>
    <p n="136">To Florence and God the wrong was done , Through the first republic 's murder there By Cosimo and his cursed son . )</p>
    <p n="137">The Duke ( with the statue 's face in the square ) 40 Turned in the midst of his multitude At the bright approach of the bridal pair .</p>
    <p n="138">Face to face the lovers stood A single minute and no more , While the bridegroom bent as a man subdued —</p>
    <p n="139">Bowed till his bonnet brushed the floor — For the Duke on the lady a kiss conferred , As the courtly custom was of yore .</p>
    <p n="140">In a minute can lovers exchange a word ? If a word did pass , which I do not think , 50 Only one out of the thousand heard .</p>
    <p n="141">That was the bridegroom . At day 's brink He and his bride were alone at last In a bedchamber by a taper 's blink .</p>
    <p n="142">Calmly he said that her lot was cast , That the door she had passed was shut on her Till the final catafalk repassed .</p>
    <p n="143">The world meanwhile , its noise and stir , Through a certain window facing the East , She could watch like a convent 's chronicler . 60</p>
    <p n="144">Since passing the door might lead to a feast And a feast might lead to so much beside , He , of many evils , chose the least .</p>
    <p n="145">“ Freely I choose too , ” said the bride — “ Your window and its world suffice , ” Replied the tongue , while the heart replied —</p>
    <p n="146">“ If I spend the night with that devil twice , May his window serve as my loop of hell Whence a damned soul looks on paradise !</p>
    <p n="147">“ I fly to the Duke who loves me well , 70 Sit by his side and laugh at sorrow ! Ere I count another ave-bell ,</p>
    <p n="148">“ ‘ Tis only the coat of a page to borrow , And tie my hair in a horse-boy 's trim , And I save my soul — but not to-morrow ” —</p>
    <p n="149">( She checked herself and her eye grew dim ) “ My father tarries to bless my state : I must keep it one day more for him .</p>
    <p n="150">“ Is one day more so long to wait ? Moreover the Duke rides past , I know ; 80 We shall see each other , sure as fate . ”</p>
    <p n="151">She turned on her side and slept . Just so ! So we resolve on a thing and sleep : So did the lady , ages ago .</p>
    <p n="152">That night the Duke said , “ Dear or cheap As the cost of this cup of bliss may prove To body or soul , I will drain it deep . ”</p>
    <p n="153">And on the morrow , bold with love , He beckoned the bridegroom ( close on call , As his duty bade , by the Duke 's alcove ) 90</p>
    <p n="154">And smiled , “ ‘ Twas a very funeral , Your lady will think , this feast of ours , A shame to efface , whate'er befall !</p>
    <p n="155">“ What if we break from the Arno bowers , And try if Petraja , cool and green , Cure last night 's fault with this morning 's flowers ? ”</p>
    <p n="156">The bridegroom , not a thought to be seen On his steady brow and quiet mouth , Said , “ Too much favour for me so mean !</p>
    <p n="157">“ But , alas ! my lady leaves the South ; 100 Each wind that comes from the Apennine Is a menace to her tender youth :</p>
    <p n="158">“ Nor a way exists , the wise opine , If she quits her palace twice this year , To avert the flower of life 's decline . ”</p>
    <p n="159">Quoth the Duke , “ A sage and a kindly fear . Moreover Petraja is cold this spring : Be our feast to-night as usual here ! ”</p>
    <p n="160">And then to himself — “ Which night shall bring Thy bride to her lover 's embraces , fool — 110 Or I am the fool , and thou art the king !</p>
    <p n="161">“ Yet my passion must wait a night , nor cool — For to-night the Envoy arrives from France Whose heart I unlock with thyself my tool .</p>
    <p n="162">“ I need thee still and might miss perchance . To-day is not wholly lost , beside , With its hope of my lady 's countenance :</p>
    <p n="163">“ For I ride — what should I do but ride ? And passing her palace , if I list , May glance at its window-well betide ! ” 120</p>
    <p n="164">So said , so done : nor the lady missed One ray that broke from the ardent brow , Nor a curl of the lips where the spirit kissed .</p>
    <p n="165">Be sure that each renewed the vow , No morrow 's sun should arise and set And leave them then as it left them now .</p>
    <p n="166">But next day passed , and next day yet , With still fresh cause to wait one day more Ere each leaped over the parapet .</p>
    <p n="167">And still , as love 's brief morning wore , 130 With a gentle start , half smile , half sigh , They found love not as it seemed before .</p>
    <p n="168">They thought it would work infallibly , But not in despite of heaven and earth : The rose would blow when the storm passed by .</p>
    <p n="169">Meantime they could profit in winter 's dearth By store of fruits that supplant the rose : The world and its ways have a certain worth :</p>
    <p n="170">And to press a point while these oppose Were simple policy ; better wait : 140 We lose no friends and we gain no foes .</p>
    <p n="171">Meantime , worse fates than a lover 's fate Who daily may ride and pass and look Where his lady watches behind the grate !</p>
    <p n="172">And she — she watched the square like a book Holding one picture and only one , Which daily to find she undertook :</p>
    <p n="173">When the picture was reached the book was done , And she turned from the picture at night to scheme Of tearing it out for herself next sun . 150</p>
    <p n="174">So weeks grew months , years ; gleam by gleam The glory dropped from their youth and love , And both perceived they had dreamed a dream ;</p>
    <p n="175">Which hovered as dreams do , still above : But who can take a dream for a truth ? Oh , hide our eyes from the next remove !</p>
    <p n="176">One day as the lady saw her youth Depart , and the silver thread that streaked Her hair , and , worn by the serpent 's tooth ,</p>
    <p n="177">The brow so puckered , the chin so peaked , 160 And wondered who the woman was , Hollow-eyed and haggard-cheeked ,</p>
    <p n="178">Fronting her silent in the glass — “ Summon here , ” she suddenly said , “ Before the rest of my old self pass ,</p>
    <p n="179">“ Him , the Carver , a hand to aid , Who fashions the clay no love will change And fixes a beauty never to fade .</p>
    <p n="180">“ Let Robbia 's craft so apt and strange Arrest the remains of young and fair , 170 And rivet them while the seasons range .</p>
    <p n="181">“ Make me a face on the window there , Waiting as ever , mute the while , My love to pass below in the square !</p>
    <p n="182">“ And let me think that it may beguile Dreary days which the dead must spend Down in their darkness under the aisle ,</p>
    <p n="183">“ To say , ‘ What matters it at the end ? ‘ I did no more while my heart was warm Than does that image , my pale-faced friend . ’ 180</p>
    <p n="184">“ Where is the use of the lip 's red charm , The heaven of hair , the pride of the brow , And the blood that blues the inside arm —</p>
    <p n="185">“ Unless we turn , as the soul knows how , The earthly gift to an end divine ? A lady of clay is as good , I trow . ”</p>
    <p n="186">But long ere Robbia 's cornice , fine , With flowers and fruits which leaves enlace , Was set where now is the empty shrine —</p>
    <p n="187">( And , leaning out of a bright blue space , 190 As a ghost might lean from a chink of sky , The passionate pale lady 's face —</p>
    <p n="188">Eyeing ever , with earnest eye And quick-turned neck at its breathless stretch , Some one who ever is passing by )</p>
    <p n="189">The Duke had sighed like the simplest wretch In Florence , “ Youth — my dream escapes ! Will its record stay ? ” And he bade them fetch</p>
    <p n="190">Some subtle moulder of brazen shapes — “ Can the soul , the will , die out of a man 200 Ere his body find the grave that gapes ?</p>
    <p n="191">“ John of Douay shall effect my plan , Set me on horseback here aloft , Alive , as the crafty sculptor can ,</p>
    <p n="192">“ In the very square I have crossed so oft : That men may admire , when future suns Shall touch the eyes to a purpose soft ,</p>
    <p n="193">“ While the mouth and the brow stay brave in bronze — Admire and say , ‘ When he was alive How he would take his pleasure once ! ’ 210</p>
    <p n="194">“ And it shall go hard but I contrive To listen the while , and laugh in my tomb At idleness which aspires to strive . ”</p>
    <p n="195">So ! While these wait the trump of doom , How do their spirits pass , I wonder , Nights and days in the narrow room ?</p>
    <p n="196">Still , I suppose , they sit and ponder What a gift life was , ages ago , Six steps out of the chapel yonder .</p>
    <p n="197">Only they see not God , I know , 220 Nor all that chivalry of his , The soldier-saints who , row on row ,</p>
    <p n="198">Burn upward each to his point of bliss — Since , the end of life being manifest , He had burned his way thro ’ the world to this .</p>
    <p n="199">I hear you reproach , “ But delay was best , For their end was a crime . ” Oh , a crime will do As well , I reply , to serve for a test ,</p>
    <p n="200">As a virtue golden through and through , Sufficient to vindicate itself 230 And prove its worth at a moment 's view !</p>
    <p n="201">Must a game be played for the sake of pelf Where a button goes , ‘ twere an epigram To offer the stamp of the very Guelph .</p>
    <p n="202">The true has no value beyond the sham : As well the counter as coin , I submit , When your table 's a hat , and your prize a dram .</p>
    <p n="203">Stake your counter as boldly every whit , Venture as warily , use the same skill , Do your best , whether winning or losing it , 240</p>
    <p n="204">If you choose to play !— is my principle . Let a man contend to the uttermost For his life 's set prize , be it what it will !</p>
    <p n="205">The counter our lovers staked was lost As surely as if it were lawful coin : And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost</p>
    <p n="206">Is — the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin , Though the end in sight was a vice , I say . You of the virtue ( we issue join ) How strive you ? De te , fabula ! 250</p>
    <p n="207">NOTES : “ The Statue and the Bust ” creates the characters and the situation , and dramatically represents a story which is based on a Florentine tradition that Duke Ferdinand I placed his equestrian statue in the Piazza dell ’ Annunziata so that he might gaze forever towards the old Riccardi Palace , where a lady he loved was imprisoned by her jealous husband . The bride and her ducal lover are seen exchanging their first looks , through which they perceive the genuineness of their love ; and the temporizing of each is presented , through which , for the sake of petty conveniences , they submit to be thwarted by the wary husband , and to have the end they count supreme delayed until love and youth have gone , and the best left them is the artificial gaze interchanged by a bronze statue in the square and a clay face at the window . The closing stanzas point the moral against the palsy of the will , whose strenuous exercise is life 's main gift .</p>
    <p n="208">I . There 's a palace in Florence : refers to the old Riccardi Palace , now the Palazzo Antinori , in the square of the Annunziata , where the statue still stands .</p>
    <p n="209">22. encolure : neck and shoulder of a horse</p>
    <p n="210">33 . The pile which the mighty shadow makes : refers to another palace in the Via Larga where the duke ( not the lady ) lived , and which is to-day known as the Riccardi Palace . Cooke 's “ Browning Guide Book ” and Berdoe 's “ Browning Cyclopaedia ” both confuse the two , attributing error to Browning in spite of his letter about it . This confusion was cleared up by Harriet Ford ( Poet-lore , Dec. 1891 , vol . iii . p. 648 , “ Browning right about the Riccardi Palace'’ ) .</p>
    <p n="211">36 . Because of a crime , etc . : refers to the destroying of the liberties of the Florentine republic by Cosimo dei Medici and his grandson , Lorenzo , who lived in the then Medici ( now Riccardi ) Palace , whose darkening of the street with its bulk symbolizes the crime which took the light from Florence .</p>

    <p n="215">169 . Robbia 's craft : the Robbia family were skilled in shaping the bisque known as Della Robbia ware which was long one of the Florentine manufactures , and traces of which , when Browning wrote , still adorned the outer cornice of the palace .</p>

    <p n="218">PORPHYRIA 'S LOVER</p>
    <p n="219">The rain set early in to-night , The sullen wind was soon awake , It tore the elm-tops down for spite , And did its worst to vex the lake : I listened with heart fit to break . When glided in Porphyria ; straight She shut the cold out and the storm , And kneeled and made the cheerless grate Blaze up , and all the cottage warm ; Which done , she rose , and from her form 10 Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl , And laid her soiled gloves by , untied Her hat and let the damp hair fall , And , last , she sat down by my side And called me . When no voice replied , She put my arm about her waist , And made her smooth white shoulder bare , And all her yellow hair displaced , And , stooping , made my cheek lie there , And spread , o'er all , her yellow hair , 20 Murmuring how she loved me — she Too weak , for all her heart 's endeavour , To set its struggling passion free From pride , and vainer ties dissever , And give herself to me for ever . But passion sometimes would prevail , Nor could to-night 's gay feast restrain A sudden thought of one so pale For love of her , and all in vain : So , she was come through wind and rain . 30</p>
    <p n="220">Be sure I looked up at her eyes Happy and proud ; at last I knew Porphyria worshipped me ; surprise Made my heart swell , and still it grew While I debated what to do . That moment she was mine , mine , fair , Perfectly pure and good : I found A thing to do , and all her hair In one long yellow string I wound Three times her little throat around , 40 And strangled her . No pain felt she ; I am quite sure she felt no pain . As a shut bud that holds a bee , I warily oped her lids : again Laughed the blue eyes without a stain . And I untightened next the tress About her neck ; her cheek once more Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss : I propped her head up as before , Only , this time my shoulder bore 50 Her head , which droops upon it still : The smiling rosy little head , So glad it has its utmost will , That all it scorned at once is fled , And I , its love , am gained instead ! Porphyria 's love : she guessed not how Her darling one wish would be heard . And thus we sit together now , And all night long we have not stirred , And yet God has not said a word ! 60</p>
    <p n="221">NOTES : “ Porphyria 's Lover ” relates how , by strangling Porphyria with her own yellow hair , the lover seized and preserved the moment of perfect love when , pure and good , Porphyria left the world she could not forego for his sake , and came to him , for once conquered by her love . A latent misgiving as to his action is intimated in the closing line of the poem . Remarking upon the fact that Browning removed the original title , “ Madhouse Cells , ” which headed this poem , and “ Johannes Agricola in Meditation , ” Mrs. Orr says : “ Such a crime might be committed in a momentary aberration , or even intense excitement of feeling . It is characterized here by a matter-of-fact simplicity , which is its sign of madness . The distinction , however , is subtle ; and we can easily guess why this and its companion poem did not retain their title . A madness which is fit for dramatic treatment is not sufficiently removed from sanity . ”</p>

    <p n="223">( See Edgar 's song in “ LEAR . ” )</p>
    <p n="224">I</p>
    <p n="225">My first thought was , he lied in every word , That hoary cripple , with malicious eye Askance to watch the working of his lie On mine , and mouth scarce able to afford Suppression of the glee , that pursed and scored Its edge , at one more victim gained thereby .</p>
    <p n="226">II</p>
    <p n="227">What else should he be set for , with his staff ? What , save to waylay with his lies , ensnare All travellers who might find him posted there , 10 And ask the road ? I guessed what skull-like laugh Would break , what crutch ‘ gin write my epitaph For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare ,</p>
    <p n="228">III</p>
    <p n="229">If at his counsel I should turn aside Into that ominous tract which , all agree Hides the Dark Tower . Yet acquiescingly I did turn as he pointed : neither pride Nor hope rekindling at the end descried So much as gladness that some end might be .</p>
    <p n="230">IV</p>
    <p n="231">For , what with my whole world-wide wandering , What with my search drawn out thro ’ years , my hope 20 Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope With that obstreperous joy success would bring , I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring My heart made , finding failure in its scope .</p>
    <p n="232">V</p>
    <p n="233">As when a sick man very near to death Seems dead indeed , and feels begin and end The tears and takes the farewell of each friend , And hears one bid the other go , draw breath Freelier outside ( “ since all is o'er , ” he saith , “ And the blow fallen no grieving can amend ” ) ; 30</p>
    <p n="234">VI</p>
    <p n="235">While some discuss if near the other graves Be room enough for this , and when a day Suits best for carrying the corpse away , With care about the banners , scarves and staves : And still the man hears all , and only craves He may not shame such tender love and stay .</p>
    <p n="236">VII</p>
    <p n="237">Thus , I had so long suffered in this quest , Heard failure prophesied so oft , been writ So many times among “ The Band ” — to wit , The knights who to the Dark Tower 's search addressed 40 Their steps — that just to fail as they , seemed best , And all the doubt was now — should I be fit ?</p>
    <p n="238">VIII</p>
    <p n="239">So , quiet as despair , I turned from him , That hateful cripple , out of his highway Into the path he pointed . All the day Had been a dreary one at best , and dim Was settling to its close , yet shot one grim Red leer to see the plain catch its estray .</p>
    <p n="240">IX</p>
    <p n="241">For mark ! no sooner was I fairly found Pledged to the plain , after a pace or two , 50 Than , pausing to throw backward a last view O'er the safe road , ‘ twas gone ; grey plain all round : Nothing but plain to the horizon 's bound . I might go on ; nought else remained to do .</p>
    <p n="242">X</p>
    <p n="243">So , on I went . I think I never saw Such starved ignoble nature ; nothing throve : For flowers-as well expect a cedar grove ! But cockle , spurge , according to their law Might propagate their kind , with none to awe , You 'd think ; a burr had been a treasure trove . 60</p>
    <p n="244">XI</p>
    <p n="245">No ! penury , inertness and grimace , In some strange sort , were the land 's portion . “ See Or shut your eyes , ” said Nature peevishly , “ It nothing skills : I cannot help my case : ‘ Tis the Last Judgment 's fire must cure this place , Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free . ”</p>

    <p n="247">If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk Above its mates , the head was chopped ; the bents Were jealous else .

    <p n="249">As for the grass , it grew as scant as hair In leprosy ; thin dry blades pricked the mud Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood . One stiff blind horse , his every bone a-stare , Stood stupefied , however he came there : Thrust out past service from the devil 's stud !</p>

    <p n="251">Alive ? he might be dead for aught I know , With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain , 80 And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane ; Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe ; I never saw a brute I hated so ; He must be wicked to deserve such pain .</p>

    <p n="253">I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart . As a man calls for wine before he fights , I asked one draught of earlier , happier sights , Ere fitly I could hope to play my part . Think first , fight afterwards — the soldier 's art : One taste of the old time sets all to rights . 90</p>
    <p n="254">XVI</p>
    <p n="255">Not it ! I fancied Cuthbert 's reddening face Beneath its garniture of curly gold , Dear fellow , till I almost felt him fold An arm in mine to fix me to the place That way he used . Alas , one night 's disgrace ! Out went my heart 's new fire and left it cold .</p>
    <p n="256">XVII</p>
    <p n="257">Giles then , the soul of honour — there he stands Frank as ten years ago when knighted first . What honest man should dare ( he said ) he durst . Good- = but the scene shifts — faugh ! what hangman hands 100 Pin to his breast a parchment ? His own bands Read it . Poor traitor , spit upon and curst !</p>
    <p n="258">XVIII</p>
    <p n="259">Better this present than a past like that ; Back therefore to my darkening path again ! No sound , no sight as far as eye could strain . Will the night send a howlet or a bat ? I asked : when something on the dismal flat Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train .</p>
    <p n="260">XIX</p>
    <p n="261">A sudden little river crossed my path As unexpected as a serpent comes . 110 No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms ; This , as it frothed by , might have been a bath For the fiend 's glowing hoof — to see the wrath Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes .</p>
    <p n="262">XX</p>
    <p n="263">So petty yet so spiteful ! All along , Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit Of mute despair , a suicidal throng : The river which had done them all the wrong , Whate'er that was , rolled by , deterred no whit . 120</p>
    <p n="264">XXI</p>
    <p n="265">Which , while I forded ,— good saints , how I feared To set my foot upon a dead man 's cheek , Each step , or feel the spear I thrust to seek For hollows , tangled in his hair or beard ! — It may have been a water-rat I speared , But , ugh ! it sounded like a baby 's shriek .</p>
    <p n="266">XXII</p>
    <p n="267">Glad was I when I reached the other bank . Now for a better country . Vain presage ! Who were the strugglers , what war did they wage , Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank 130 Soil to a plash ? Toads in a poisoned tank , Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage —</p>
    <p n="268">XXIII</p>
    <p n="269">The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque . What penned them there , with all the plain to choose ? No foot-print leading to that horrid mews , None out of it . Mad brewage set to work Their brains , no doubt , like galley-slaves the Turk Pits for his pastime , Christians against Jews .</p>
    <p n="270">XXIV</p>
    <p n="271">And more than that — a furlong on — why , there ! What bad use was that engine for , that wheel , 140 Or brake , not wheel — that harrow fit to reel Men 's bodies out like silk ? with all the air Of Tophet 's tool , on earth left unaware Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel .</p>
    <p n="272">XXV</p>
    <p n="273">Then came a bit of stubbed ground , once a wood , Next a marsh , it would seem , and now mere earth Desperate and done with ; ( so a fool finds mirth , Makes a thing and then mars it , till his mood Changes and off he goes ! ) within a rood — Bog , clay and rubble , sand and stark black dearth . 150</p>
    <p n="274">XXVI</p>
    <p n="275">Now blotches rankling , coloured gay and grim , Now patches where some leanness of the soil 's Broke into moss or substances like boils ; Then came some palsied oak , a cleft in him Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim Gaping at death , and dies while it recoils .</p>
    <p n="276">XXVII</p>
    <p n="277">And just as far as ever from the end ! Nought in the distance but the evening , nought To point my footstep further ! At the thought A great black bird , Apollyon 's bosom-friend , 160 Sailed past , nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned That brushed my cap — perchance the guide I sought .</p>
    <p n="278">XXVIII</p>
    <p n="279">For , looking up , aware I somehow grew , ‘ Spite of the dusk , the plain had given place All round to mountains — with such name to grace Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view . How thus they had surprised me ,— solve it , you ! How to get from them was no clearer case .</p>
    <p n="280">XXIX</p>
    <p n="281">Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick Of mischief happened to me , God knows when — 170 In a bad dream perhaps . Here ended , then , Progress this way . When , in the very nick Of giving up , one time more , came a click As when a trap shuts — you 're inside the den !</p>
    <p n="282">XXX</p>
    <p n="283">Burningly it came on me all at once , This was the place ! those two hills on the right Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight ; While to the left , a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce , Dotard , a-dozing at the very nonce , After a life spent training for the sight ! 180</p>
    <p n="284">XXXI</p>
    <p n="285">What in the midst lay but the Tower itself ? The round squat turret , blind as the fool 's heart , Built of brown stone , without a counterpart In the whole world . The tempest 's mocking elf Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf He strikes on , only when the timbers start .</p>
    <p n="286">XXXII</p>
    <p n="287">Not see ? because of night perhaps ?— why , day Came back again for that ! before it left , The dying sunset kindled through a cleft : The hills , like giants at a hunting , lay , 190 Chin upon hand , to see the game at bay ,— “ Now stab and end the creature — to the heft ! ”</p>
    <p n="288">XXXIII</p>
    <p n="289">Not hear ? when noise was everywhere ! it tolled Increasing like a bell . Names in my ears Of all the lost adventurers my peers ,— How such a one was strong , and such was bold , And such was fortunate , yet each of old Lost , lost ! one moment knelled the woe of years .</p>
    <p n="290">XXXIV</p>
    <p n="291">There they stood , ranged along the hill-sides , met To view the last of me , a living frame 200 For one more picture ! in a sheet of flame I saw them and I knew them all . And yet Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set , And blew . “ Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came . ”</p>
    <p n="292">NOTES : “ Childe Roland ” symbolizes the conquest of despair by fealty to the ideal . Browning emphatically disclaimed any precise allegorical intention in this poem . He acknowledged only an ideal purport in which the significance of the whole , as suggesting a vision of life and the saving power of constancy , had its due place . Certain picturesque materials which had made their impressions on the poet 's mind contributed towards the building up of this realistic fantasy : a tower he saw in the Carrara Mountains ; a painting which caught his eye later in Paris ; the figure of a horse in the tapestry in his own drawing-room — welded together with the remembrance of the line cited from King Lear , iii . 4 , 187 , which last , it should be remembered , has a background of ballads and legend cycles of which a man like Browning was not unaware . For allegorical schemes of the Poem see Nettleship 's “ Essays and Thoughts , ” and The Critic , Apr . 24 , 1886 ; for an antidote to these , The Critic , May 8 , 1886 ; an orthodox view , Poet-lore , Nov. 1890 : for interpretations touching on the ballad sources , London Browning Society Papers , part iii . p. 21 , and Poet-lore , Aug. - Sept. 1892 .</p>
